# Discussion

The present study offers a comprehensive analysis of new-onset delirium in a large cohort of stroke patients, emphasizing the significant role of biological sex and various clinical factors in its occurrence. By integrating a wide range of variables—including demographics, clinical presentations, therapeutic interventions, and medications—the study provides valuable insights that contribute to the existing literature on post-stroke delirium and have important implications for clinical practice and future research.

Occurrence of Delirium and Sex Differences

Delirium occurred in 6.3% of patients in this study, with a notably higher incidence in males (7.3%) compared to females (4.8%). This significant sex difference persisted even after adjusting for confounding factors such as age and stroke severity, with male sex remaining an independent predictor of delirium (odds ratio 2.1, 95% credible interval 1.68–2.66). These findings align with several previous studies that have reported a higher risk of delirium in males following stroke or other acute medical conditions. For instance, Oldenbeuving et al. (2011) identified male sex as a risk factor for delirium in acute stroke patients, and similar associations have been observed in other settings, such as intensive care units (Zhang et al., 2013).

In a meta-analysis of vascular risk factors Siokas and colleagues investigated also the influence of biological sex on delirium. They included

The biological underpinnings of this sex difference are not fully understood but may involve hormonal influences, differences in brain structure and function, or varying responses to stress and inflammation. Estrogen, for example, has been suggested to have neuroprotective effects that could mitigate the risk of delirium in females (Barron et al., 2017). The implications of this finding are significant for clinical practice. Recognizing male sex as a risk factor for delirium can prompt healthcare providers to implement targeted monitoring and preventive strategies for male patients, potentially reducing the incidence and severity of delirium in this population.

Age and Its Interaction with Sex

The study demonstrated a meaningful association between age and the occurrence of delirium, with older patients exhibiting a higher probability of developing delirium. This is consistent with the well-established understanding that advanced age is a major risk factor for delirium due to age-related physiological changes, increased comorbidities, and decreased cognitive reserve (Inouye et al., 2014). Notably, the interaction between age and sex revealed that females between the ages of 70 and 90 were less likely to develop delirium compared to their male counterparts. This suggests that the protective factors associated with female sex may become more pronounced with advancing age. While some studies have reported similar findings (Fong et al., 2009), others have not observed significant sex differences in age-related delirium risk (Oh et al., 2015). The present study adds to this body of knowledge by highlighting the need for age- and sex-specific approaches to delirium prevention.

Premorbid Function and Delirium

The premorbid Rankin Scale (pRS) was used to assess the relationship between pre-stroke functional status and delirium occurrence. Contrary to expectations, none of the pRS levels showed a convincing association with delirium. This finding differs from previous research that has identified poor premorbid functional status as an independent risk factor for delirium [@pasinska2018]. One possible explanation is the relatively low number of patients in the higher pRS categories in this study, which may have limited the statistical power for detection.

Stroke Severity, Location, and Delirium As anticipated, higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, indicating more severe strokes, were strongly associated with an increased probability of delirium (odds ratio 1.456). This aligns with existing literature, as severe strokes are more likely to result in extensive brain damage, increased intracranial pressure, and a greater burden of neurological deficits, all of which can contribute to delirium (Shi et al., 2019). Furthermore, strokes in the right hemisphere and posterior circulation were linked to a higher likelihood of delirium compared to left hemispheric strokes. Right hemispheric strokes can affect attentional networks and spatial awareness, potentially leading to neglect and confusion, which are risk factors for delirium (Voyer et al., 2012). Posterior circulation strokes may involve the brainstem and cerebellum, areas critical for arousal and consciousness, thereby increasing the risk of delirium (Kase et al., 1995). These findings emphasize the importance of considering stroke location and severity in delirium risk assessments. Clinicians should be particularly vigilant in monitoring patients with severe strokes and those involving the right hemisphere or posterior circulation. Influence of Therapy Modes on Delirium The mode of therapy was also associated with the occurrence of delirium. Patients receiving endovascular therapy had higher odds of developing delirium than those receiving intravenous thrombolysis (odds ratio 0.749). After adjusting for age and NIHSS scores, this association was partially explained, suggesting that the increased delirium risk may be related to the severity of the stroke necessitating endovascular intervention. Previous studies have yielded mixed results regarding the impact of therapeutic interventions on delirium risk. Some research indicates that more invasive procedures may elevate delirium risk due to factors like anesthesia, procedural complications, and increased physiological stress (Brummel et al., 2014). However, other studies have not found significant differences between treatment modalities (Abelha et al., 2013). The present findings highlight the need for further investigation into how specific therapies influence delirium risk and underscore the importance of careful patient selection and perioperative care. Aphasia, Sex Differences, and Delirium The presence and severity of aphasia were analyzed in relation to delirium occurrence. While aphasia severity alone showed variable and uncertain effects, a significant interaction between aphasia severity and sex was evident. Males with moderate to severe aphasia were significantly more likely to develop delirium compared to females with the same level of aphasia. Aphasia can impair communication, leading to frustration, isolation, and difficulty in expressing needs, which may contribute to delirium (Smith et al., 2017). The observed sex difference may be related to differences in coping mechanisms, social support networks, or neurological factors such as brain plasticity and language processing. Some studies suggest that females may have a greater capacity for language recovery due to bilateral language representation in the brain (Friedrich et al., 2015). These findings suggest that male patients with aphasia are a high-risk group for delirium and may benefit from enhanced communication support and interventions aimed at reducing delirium risk. Neglect Syndromes and Delirium Neglect syndromes, characterized by a lack of awareness of one side of space or the body, were associated with higher odds of delirium across all levels of severity. This association is consistent with the understanding that neglect can lead to disorientation, impaired mobility, and decreased ability to interact with the environment, all of which can contribute to delirium (Cherney & Halper, 2001). An interesting finding was the significant interaction between visual neglect and sex, with females being more at risk of developing delirium in this context. While some studies have reported that neglect is more common or severe in males (Buxbaum et al., 2004), the present study suggests that when females do experience neglect, it may have a greater impact on delirium risk. This could be due to differences in how males and females perceive and compensate for neglect or varying lesion patterns. Further research is needed to explore these sex-specific effects. Level of Consciousness and Delirium Reduced levels of consciousness at admission, such as somnolence, sopor, and coma, were associated with a higher likelihood of developing delirium. This is consistent with previous findings that decreased arousal and altered mental status are risk factors for delirium (Gusmao-Flores et al., 2012). Interestingly, males were less likely to present with worse levels of consciousness but had a higher likelihood of delirium when awake or somnolent. This suggests that even when presenting with similar levels of consciousness, males may be more susceptible to delirium, potentially due to differences in vulnerability to stressors, inflammatory responses, or other physiological factors. Microangiopathy and Delirium The presence of moderate to severe cerebral microangiopathy was associated with increased odds of delirium. Cerebral microangiopathy reflects small vessel disease, which can lead to white matter lesions, reduced cerebral blood flow, and impaired cognitive function (Patel & Markus, 2011). These changes can decrease the brain's resilience to acute insults like stroke, increasing the risk of delirium. Females exhibited a higher frequency of severe microangiopathy, which may be related to factors such as longer lifespan, hormonal influences, or comorbid conditions like hypertension and diabetes. The sex difference in microangiopathy prevalence and its impact on delirium risk warrants further investigation. Alcohol Consumption, Dementia, and Delirium Males were more likely to report moderate to severe alcohol consumption prior to stroke, but this did not show a significant association with delirium in the study. This contrasts with some literature suggesting that alcohol abuse is a risk factor for delirium due to withdrawal effects and neurotoxicity (Siddiqi et al., 2006). The lack of association may be due to underreporting, the classification of alcohol consumption levels, or the influence of other variables. Known dementia was more prevalent in females (5.5%) than males (2.8%), and having a previous diagnosis of dementia increased the likelihood of developing delirium (odds ratio 1.92). This is consistent with extensive research indicating that pre-existing cognitive impairment is one of the strongest predictors of delirium (Inouye et al., 2014). The sex-specific interaction, with females having an increased risk of delirium when dementia is present, may reflect the higher prevalence of dementia in females and possibly differences in disease progression or brain reserve. Medications and Delirium The study examined the association between various medications and the risk of delirium, revealing several notable findings. Medications Associated with Increased Delirium Risk: Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs): Patients using ARBs prior to stroke had higher odds of developing delirium (odds ratio 1.506). While ARBs are commonly prescribed for hypertension and have neuroprotective properties, some evidence suggests they may influence cognitive function and cerebral perfusion (Wright et al., 2013). Pyrazolones: This class, including metamizole, showed a positive association with delirium (odds ratio 1.354). Pyrazolones have analgesic properties but may cause central nervous system side effects. Other Antiepileptics (ATC code N03AX): Medications like lamotrigine and levetiracetam were associated with increased delirium risk (odds ratio 1.832), potentially due to their effects on neurotransmitter systems and sedation. Medications with Potential Protective Effects Against Delirium: Glucocorticoids: Associated with a decreased risk of delirium (odds ratio -0.90). Glucocorticoids have anti-inflammatory effects that may reduce cerebral edema and oxidative stress, potentially mitigating delirium risk (Schwab et al., 2011). However, they can also cause neuropsychiatric side effects, so this finding should be interpreted with caution. Potassium Supplementation: Showed a protective effect (odds ratio -0.73). Adequate potassium levels are essential for neuronal function, and hypokalemia may contribute to delirium (Vasudev & Shah, 2009). The interaction model revealed that certain medications had different effects on delirium risk depending on sex. For example, thiazides, digitalis glycosides, and aldosterone antagonists were associated with higher delirium risk in males. These medications can affect electrolyte balance and cardiovascular function, which may differentially impact males due to physiological differences. These findings highlight the importance of medication review in stroke patients and suggest that clinicians should be attentive to the potential neuropsychiatric effects of certain medications, especially in male patients. Outcomes and Influence of Delirium and Sex Delirium was associated with worse outcomes, including longer hospital stays, lower Barthel Index scores at discharge, and higher mortality rates. Patients who developed delirium had greater dependency and poorer functional recovery, which is consistent with previous studies demonstrating the adverse impact of delirium on rehabilitation and long-term outcomes (McManus et al., 2009). Regarding sex differences, males had slightly better NIHSS scores at discharge and higher percentages of favorable outcomes on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) after three months. However, females had a higher mortality rate at three months. These differences may reflect variations in stroke severity, access to rehabilitation services, comorbidities, or social support systems. Understanding the influence of sex on stroke outcomes is complex. Some research suggests that females may experience worse outcomes due to factors like older age at stroke onset, higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation, and differences in healthcare utilization (Bushnell et al., 2014). The present study underscores the need for sex-specific analyses in stroke research to identify and address disparities. Strengths of the Study Large Sample Size: The inclusion of 5,772 patients enhances the statistical power and generalizability of the findings. Comprehensive Variable Analysis: The study examined a wide array of variables, including clinical features, therapies, medications, and outcomes, providing a holistic view of factors influencing delirium. Use of Advanced Statistical Methods: The application of Bayesian logistic regression allowed for probabilistic interpretations and the incorporation of prior knowledge, improving the robustness of the results. Focus on Sex Differences: By specifically analyzing the role of biological sex, the study adds valuable insights into sex-specific risk factors and outcomes. Detailed Outcome Measures: The assessment of both short-term and long-term outcomes, including functional scores and mortality, provides a comprehensive understanding of the impact of delirium. Limitations of the Study Retrospective Design: The study's retrospective nature may introduce biases related to data collection, missing data, and unmeasured confounders. Incomplete Data: Missing information on certain variables, such as premorbid Rankin Scale and alcohol consumption, could affect the validity of the analyses. Diagnosis of Delirium: The methods for diagnosing delirium were not detailed, and variability in assessment tools or clinician expertise could influence the findings. Potential Confounding Factors: While adjustments were made for several variables, unmeasured factors like socioeconomic status, cognitive reserve, or genetic predispositions might impact the results. Medication Data: Reliance on self-reported medication use prior to admission may be subject to recall bias, and over-the-counter or non-prescribed medications were not accounted for. Single-Center Data: If the data were collected from a single center or region, the findings may not be generalizable to different healthcare settings or populations. Implications for Future Research and Clinical Practice The findings of this study have significant implications for both clinical practice and future research. Risk Assessment and Monitoring: Identifying male sex, advanced age, severe stroke, aphasia, and neglect as risk factors for delirium can inform risk stratification and prompt early monitoring and intervention. Sex-Specific Interventions: The observed sex differences suggest the need for tailored approaches in delirium prevention and management, considering biological, social, and behavioral factors unique to each sex. Communication and Support Strategies: Enhancing communication support for patients with aphasia, particularly males, may reduce the risk of delirium and improve outcomes. Medication Management: Clinicians should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of medications that may influence delirium risk, especially in male patients, and consider alternatives or additional monitoring. Delirium Prevention Programs: Implementing evidence-based delirium prevention protocols, including environmental modifications, cognitive stimulation, and early mobilization, may benefit high-risk patients. Further Research: Prospective, multicenter studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore underlying mechanisms. Research into the biological basis of sex differences, the role of hormones, and genetic factors could provide deeper insights. Conclusion This study underscores the complex interplay of biological sex, clinical factors, and therapeutic interventions in the occurrence of delirium after stroke. Males are at higher risk of developing delirium, and this risk is influenced by factors such as age, stroke severity, aphasia, neglect, and certain medications. Delirium, in turn, is associated with worse functional outcomes and increased mortality. Recognizing these risk factors allows healthcare providers to implement targeted strategies to prevent and manage delirium, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms behind sex differences in delirium risk and developing interventions that address these disparities.

Strength and limitation The study is retrospective and although it employed a meticulous methodological approach, limitations inherent to this design remain.

Concerning the detection of delirium it is essential to acknowledge that different types of delirium, including hypoactive delirium, may have been underdiagnosed in our cohort. For instance, the overall rate of delirium in our cohort was 6xxx%. In a meta-analysis, Zhang and colleagues found significant variability in the occurrence of delirium, ranging from 4.9% to 66.2%. It's worth noting that our cohort, which was selected based on treatment indication, had a delirium frequency on the lower end of this spectrum. However, results from a very recent report in a severely affected stroke population that is comparable to this population, Sachdev and colleagues retrospectively found a delirium diagnosis in 24 out of 467 (5.1%) patients.

Cases of delirium might be misclassified because of inconsistent documentation practices or varying diagnostic criteria used by treating physicians. For instance, different clinicians might have interpreted symptoms of delirium differently, which leads to inconsistencies in case identification. Especially the diagnostic criteria of delirium, although following a standard operating procedure and applying well-known delirium detection scores, may have been variable over the years, may have been team-specific and individual-specific. Additionally, factors like nurse-to-patient ratios, hospital environment, and staff awareness and training on delirium recognition can affect the incidence and detection of delirium. Moreover, the study did not assess information on the severity or exact duration of delirium episodes. This may be most important for a better understanding of how delirium impacts outcome.

New variables were sourced through a semi-automatic process, which included diagnosis retrieval from the hospital information system and chart retrieval using search terms via regular expressions. Feedback loops were implemented to ensure accuracy, constantly improving the search terms and achieving a high true positive rate and a low false positive rate. Despite these measures, underdetection and misclassification cannot be entirely ruled out because of potential data entry errors and incorrect coding during chart reviews.

Moreover, the study period spans over 20 years. Over such a long time, changes in clinical practices, diagnostic criteria, and hospital standards and policies could introduce a temporal bias. However, analyses directly show differences in admission years, and admission years are accounted for in Bayesian regression analyses, which ultimately improves interpretability.

The cohort was selected based on specific treatment indications. Selection bias may be present, and the sample may not represent the general population. Additionally, it might exclude certain patient groups, limiting the generalizability of the findings to other settings or populations. Although the Heidelberg stroke center is one of the first established in Germany and known for its high-quality standards, the study is monocentric, and results need external evaluation for generability.

The study tried to include many factors associated with delirium; however, unmeasured confounders may exist, which have not been accounted for. Factors such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity, educational background, or unrecorded comorbidities may influence the occurrence of delirium and, ultimately, functional outcomes. This may lead to residual confounding. Unmeasured psychological factors like stress and anxiety can contribute to delirium but are often not recorded in medical records, leading to incomplete risk factor assessment.

Additionally, a decline in precognition that previously did not result in a dementia diagnosis would have gone unnoticed, as only established dementia diagnoses at hospital admission were assessed. Therefore, although preexisting dementia was an independent predictor for many models already, it is important to note that the frequency of dementia in this cohort may be underestimated, which could potentially bias the study's results.

The variable selection process for individual models was based on available evidence from literature reviews and information on associations from univariable or bivariable models. Although the final multivariable models included many factors associated with delirium, the Bayesian models developed for prediction were not validated in external cohorts. The study actively and openly reports missing data for variables of interest. But missing data can reduce the statistical power of the study and introduce bias if the missingness is not random, as primarily assumed. To address this potential bias, final models were additionally calculated using multiple imputation datasets.

In this study, the time at which delirium was diagnosed during the hospital stay was unavailable. Therefore, a differentiation between early-onset and late-onset delirium could not be made. Additionally, as for other outcomes that occurred during hospital stay (e.g., pneumonia), associations to delirium can only be made without a clear direction of effect. For this reason, the focus for a delirium model was set on the very early stage at hospital admission. This study collected a great number of medications that were available at hospital admission, focusing on the drug substance itself rather than detailed dosing information. During the hospital stay and thereafter, medications other than recombinant tissue plasminogen activator were not researched - this may limit the interpretability of associations of admission medications with outcomes.

This work did not focus on the exact diagnostic workup of stroke patients. Although unlikely, this may be a potential source of bias.

Date / Year generell A increase over the years of delirium could be observed. This may have several reasons. First and foremost, screening conditions for delirium and the awareness of the diagnosis and its impact may contribute to this increase. Second, the increasing number of endovascular therapies and increasing number of procedures. This does not necessarliy mean that endocvascular therapy causally increases delirium, rather being a procedure / surgery, which is generally known to increase delirium. Additionally, the circumstances may play an important role, such as mode of sedation.
