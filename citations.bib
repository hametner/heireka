  abstract = {The circle of Willis (CoW) plays a significant role in intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS). This study investigated the relationship between different types of CoW, atherosclerosis plaque features, and acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We investigated 97 participants with AIS or transient ischemic attacks (TIA) underwent pre- and post-contrast 3T vessel wall cardiovascular magnetic resonance within 7 days of the onset of symptoms. The culprit plaque characteristics (including enhancement grade, enhancement ratio, high signal in T1, irregularity of plaque surface, and normalized wall index), and vessel remodeling (including arterial remodeling ratio and positive remodeling) for lesions were evaluated. The anatomic structures of the anterior and the posterior sections of the CoW (A-CoW and P-CoW) were also evaluated. The plaque features were compared among them. The plaque features were also compared between AIS and TIA patients. Finally, univariate and multivariate regression analysis was performed to evaluate the independent risk factors for AIS. Patients with incomplete A-CoW showed a higher plaque enhancement ratio (P = 0.002), enhancement grade (P = 0.01), and normalized wall index (NWI) (P = 0.018) compared with the patients with complete A-CoW. A higher proportion of patients with incomplete symptomatic P-CoW demonstrated more culprit plaques with high T1 signals (HT1S) compared with those with complete P-CoW (P = 0.013). Incomplete A-CoW was associated with a higher enhancement grade of the culprit plaques [odds ratio (OR):3.84; 95% CI: 1.36-10.88, P = 0.011], after adjusting for clinical risk factors such as age, sex, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipemia, and diabetes mellitus. Incomplete symptomatic P-CoW was associated with a higher probability of HT1S (OR:3.88; 95% CI: 1.12-13.47, P = 0.033), after adjusting for clinical risk factors such as age, sex, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipemia, and diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, an irregularity of the plaque surface (OR: 6.24; 95% CI: 2.25-17.37, P < 0.001), and incomplete symptomatic P-CoW (OR: 8.03, 95% CI: 2.43-26.55, P = 0.001) were independently associated with AIS. This study demonstrated that incomplete A-CoW was associated with enhancement grade of the culprit plaque, and incomplete symptomatic side P-CoW was associated with the presence of HT1S of culprit plaque. Furthermore, an irregularity of plaque surface and incomplete symptomatic side P-CoW were associated with AIS.}

  abstract = {Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is one of the leading causes of stroke; each neuroimaging marker of SVD is correlated with vascular risk factors and associated with poor prognosis after stroke. However, longitudinal studies investigating the association between comprehensive SVD burden scoring system, "total SVD score" - which encompasses the established neuroimaging markers of lacunae, cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), white matter hyperintensities (WMH) including periventricular hyperintensities, and perivascular spaces in basal ganglia- and clinical outcomes are limited. The aim of this study is to determine the association between SVD burden and long-term prognosis in patients with ischemic stroke. This prospective, single-center, observational study enrolled patients with acute ischemic stroke, including cerebral infarction and transient ischemic attack. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed, and then total SVD score (range, 0-4) was calculated. We recorded baseline characteristics and evaluated the relationships of long-term outcomes to SVD neuroimaging markers and total SVD score. Stroke recurrence was thought as primary outcome. Hazard ratios (HRs) of events during follow-up were calculated using Cox proportional hazards modeling with adjustments for age, sex, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and smoking. Cumulative event rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Consecutive 564 acute ischemic stroke patients were enrolled according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 467 participants with first-ever ischemic stroke were analyzed (median age 75.0 [interquartile range, 64.0-83.0] years, 59.3% male). Total SVD score was 0 point in 47 individuals (12.0%), 1 point in 83 (21.2%), 2 points in 103 (26.3%), 3 points in 85 (21.7%), and 4 points in 73 (18.7%). Twenty-eight recurrent stroke events were identified during follow-up. Total SVD score ≥ 2, presence of CMBs, and moderate-to-severe WMH were associated with increased risk of recurrent stroke events (HR 9.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.33-64.23; HR 2.81, 95% CI 1.08-7.30; HR 2.90, 95% CI 1.22-6.88, respectively). The accumulation of SVD biomarkers as determined by total SVD score offered a reliable predictor of stroke recurrence. This study established a firm understanding of SVD prognosis in clinical settings.}

In the UK Biobank, people 40-70 years old, recruited in 2006-2010, were followed in linked primary (N = 192,983 individuals) and hospital care (N = 501,807 individuals) datasets. Regression models of annual primary and annual hospital care costs (2020 UK£) associated with individual characteristics and experiences of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, coronary revascularization, incident diabetes mellitus and cancer, and vascular and nonvascular death are reported. For both people without and with previous cardiovascular disease (CVD), primary care costs were modelled using one-part generalised linear models (GLMs) with identity link and Poisson distribution, and hospital costs with two-part models (part 1: logistic regression models the probability of incurring costs; part 2: GLM with identity link and Poisson distribution models the costs conditional on incurring any). In people without previous CVD, mean annual primary and hospital care costs were £360 and £514, respectively. The excess primary care costs were £190 and £360 following MI and stroke, respectively, whereas excess hospital costs decreased from £4340 and £5590, respectively, in the year of these events, to £190 and £410 two years later. People with previous CVD had more than twice higher annual costs, and incurred higher excess costs for cardiovascular events. Other characteristics associated with higher costs included older age, female sex, south Asian ethnicity, higher socioeconomic deprivation, smoking, lower level of physical activities, unhealthy body mass index, and comorbidities. These individual-level healthcare cost prediction models could inform assessments of the value of health technologies and policies to reduce cardiovascular and other disease risks and healthcare costs. An accompanying Excel calculator is available to facilitate the use of the models.}

  abstract = {Recurrent ischemic stroke (RIS) is associated with increased mortality and poor outcomes. Therefore, secondary prevention is critical for reducing the risk of recurrent stroke. Previous studies have found sex differences in risk factors in patients with first-ever stroke; however, the results have been inconsistent for recurrent stroke. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether there are significant sex differences in the clinical characteristics and risk factors for recurrent ischemic stroke. We retrospectively studied 787 patients with recurrent ischemic stroke after first-ever stroke confirmation using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after visiting a regional tertiary hospital between 2014 and 2020. Demographic characteristics, laboratory findings, and risk factors were compared between the male and female patients. In addition, multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the independent factors associated with stroke recurrence in male patients. Among the 787 patients, 466 (59.2%) were males. Males were younger than females (67.6 vs. 71.9 years). Females had higher rates of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and overweight than those of males. However, the alcohol drinking and smoking rate were significantly higher in males than that in females. There were no statistically significant sex-based differences in the laboratory findings. Among males, hypertension, alcohol drinking, smoking and dyslipidemia was a significant risk factor for ischemic stroke recurrence. Hypertension and dyslipidemia were significant risk factors of recurrent ischemic stroke in both genders. Smoking and alcohol drinking were significant risk factors associated with ischemic stroke recurrence in males. Therefore, smoking cessation and alcohol abstinence are recommended after the first stroke to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke especially for males. Diabetes was a significant risk factor of ischemic stroke recurrence in females. More extensive studies are needed to understand the causal relationship of each factors with ischemic stroke recurrence according to sex differences and specification of preventive management is needed.}

  abstract = {Delayed neurological improvement (DNI) is a phenomenon that involves patient improvement in the absence of early neurological change following treatment for acute ischemic stroke. The patient characteristics associated with this condition are largely unexplored. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review of the English language literature was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Web of science, and Scopus. We calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs), mean differences (MDs), and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to test the association between patient characteristics and achievement of DNI. Seven studies, with 3266 patients, were included in our analysis. All studies reported a different definition of DNI, with five studies focusing on rates of good functional outcome at 90 days post-treatment in the absence of early neurological improvement. Use of intravenous thrombolytics was associated with increased rates of DNI (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.00; p = 0.002). Atrial fibrillation was associated with decreased rates of DNI (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.82; p < 0.001), as was hypertension (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.83, p < 0.001), and diabetes mellitus (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.90; p = 0.005). On average, patients who achieved DNI were 6.30 years younger than their non-DNI counterparts (MD -6.30, 95% CI -9.19 to -3.41; p < 0.001). There were modest associations between male sex and DNI (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.74, p = 0.042), and smoking and DNI (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.59, p = 0.027). DNI is a phenomenon that is not presently well understood. Lack of uniformity among definitions of DNI hinders efforts to explore DNI and the factors associated with its occurrence. Future studies should work to establish a consensus definition of DNI to determine its causes and significance more accurately.}

  abstract = {Left ventricular (LV) geometry is closely associated with cardiovascular disease; however, few studies have evaluated the relationship between basal septal hypertrophy (BSH) and LV geometry. In this study, we examined the relationship between BSH and LV geometry in a Beijing community population. The clinical and echocardiographic data of 1032 participants from a community in Beijing were analyzed. BSH was defined as a basal interventricular septal thickness ≥ 14 mm and a basal septal thickness/mid-septal thickness ≥ 1.3. On the basis of their echocardiographic characteristics, patients were described as having a normal geometry, concentric remodeling, concentric hypertrophy, or eccentric hypertrophy. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between BSH, LV mass index (LVMI), and relative wall thickness (RWT). The prevalence of BSH was 7.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.8-9.0%). Basal and middle interventricular septal thickness, LV posterior wall thickness, and RWT were greater, while LVMI and LV end-diastolic dimension were lower in the BSH group than in the non-BSH group (p < 0.05). The BSH group accounted for the highest proportion of patients with concentric remodeling. A multivariable regression analysis showed that BSH increased by 3.99-times (odds ratio [OR] 3.99, 95% CI 2.05-7.78, p < 0.01) when RWT was > 0.42, but not when LVMI increased (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02-1.19, p = 0.07). There were no interactions between BSH and age, body mass index, sex, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, stroke, and smoking in relation to an RWT > 0.42. BSH was independently associated with an RWT > 0.42.}

We aimed to investigate the association between migraine and major cardiovascular outcomes, including myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke (IS), and cardiovascular death (CVD) in people with type 2 diabetes. A total of 2,229,598 people from the nationwide Korean National Health Insurance Service database with type 2 diabetes but without a previous history of MI and IS were included in this study. We identified patients over 20 years of age with migraine using the claim data of International Statistical Classification of Diseases Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code G43. The patients with migraine were divided according to their migraine aura status. Migraine was present in 6.3% of the study population. Cases observed for MI, IS, CVD, and all-cause death were 2.6%, 3.6%, 5.9%, and 7.9%, respectively. The diagnosis of migraine was significantly associated with an increased risk of MI, IS, and CVD. The results remained significant after adjusting for covariates, including age, sex, body mass index, alcohol intake, smoking habits, physical activity, economic status, hypertension history, dyslipidemia, and duration of type 2 diabetes (MI, adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.182, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.146-1.219; IS, aHR: 1.111, 95% CI 1.082-1.14; CVD, aHR: 1.143, 95% CI 1.12-1.167). In particular, the presence of aura was associated with a higher risk of MI development compared to the non-aura group. The difference became more prominent with progressing age. In this nationwide population-based study, people with type 2 diabetes and migraines were found to be at a significantly higher risk for major cardiovascular events, including MI, IS, and CVD. The risk of MI and CVD significantly increased with the presence of aura symptoms among patients with migraine.}

Furthermore, whether elevated blood eosinophil counts increase risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other chronic diseases, other than atopic conditions, remains uncertain. We sought to describe the distribution of eosinophil counts in the general population and determine the association of eosinophil count with prevalent chronic disease and incident CVD. A population-based adult cohort was followed from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2020. Electronic health record data regarding demographic characteristics, prevalent clinical characteristics, and incident CVD were extracted. Associations between blood eosinophil counts and demographic characteristics, chronic diseases, laboratory values, and risks of incident CVD were assessed using chi-square test, ANOVA, and Cox proportional hazards regression. Blood eosinophil counts increased with age, body mass index, and reported smoking and tobacco use. The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and cancer increased as eosinophil counts increased. Eosinophil counts were significantly associated with coronary heart disease (hazard ratio [HR], 1.44; 95% CI, 1.12-1.84) and heart failure (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.30-2.01) in fully adjusted models and with stroke/transient ischemic attack (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.16-1.61) and CVD death (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.10-2.00) in a model adjusting for age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Blood eosinophil counts differ by demographic and clinical characteristics as well as by prevalent chronic disease. Moreover, elevated eosinophil counts are associated with risk of CVD. Further prospective investigations are needed to determine the utility of eosinophil counts as a biomarker for CVD risk.}

Patients admitted nationally for HFmrEF (ejection fraction 40-49%) between 2008 and 2014 were included and followed up until December 2016. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular (CV) death and/or heart failure (HF) rehospitalisations. A total of 2,272 HFmrEF patients (56% male) were included. More women had DM than men (60% versus 55%, P=0.013). Regardless of DM status, HFmrEF females were older, less likely to smoke, had less coronary artery disease, narrower QRS and lower haemoglobin compared to men. The odds of having DM decreases in smokers who are women as opposed to men (Pinteraction =0.017). In multivariate analysis, DM reached statistical analysis for all-cause mortality and combined CV mortality or HF rehospitalisation in both men and women. However, the results suggest that there may be sex differences in terms of outcomes. DM (vs non-DM) was less strongly associated with increased all-cause mortality (adjusted hazards ratio [adj HR] 1.234 vs adj HR 1.290, Pinteraction <0.001] but more strongly associated with the combined CV death/HF rehospitalisation (adj HR 1.429 vs adj HR 1.317, Pinteraction =0.027) in women (vs men). Asian women with HFmrEF had a higher prevalence of DM, with differences in clinical characteristics, compared to men. While diabetes conferred poor outcomes regardless of sex, there were distinct sex differences. These highlight the need for sex-specific management strategies.}

Single-vessel disease was more common in younger patients while multivessel involvement was more common in elderly patients. Older patients had longer hospital stays and more in-hospital MACE including deaths. By multivariate analysis, shock was found to be an independent predictor of MACE in both groups. Younger ACS patients have a different risk profile and better in-hospital outcomes compared to older patients.}

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the ratio of triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (TG/HDL-C) is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study was to investigate the nonlinear relationship between TG/HDL-C and the incidence of T2DM in a Chinese population. We used logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the incidence of T2DM among 7,791 participants from the Risk Evaluation of cAncers in Chinese diabeTic Individuals: a lONgitudinal (REACTION) cohort study at baseline. After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol intake, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, strenuous activity, education level, family histories of T2DM and tumors, and the presence of hypertension, tumor, stroke, and coronary heart disease, we showed that TG/HDL-C was positively associated with the incidence of T2DM at the 4-year follow-up (OR = 1.49, 95%CI = 1.26-1.78). TG/HDL-C and incidence of T2DM showed a nonlinear relationship; the inflection point of TG/HDL-C was 1.50. The ORs (95% CI) on the left and right sides of the inflection point were 2.50 (1.70-3.67) and 0.96 (0.67-1.37), respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) in the linear relationship, the OR of the incidence of T2DM was 1.60 (95%CI = 1.37-1.87). When the TG/HDL-C was less than 1.50 or greater than 1.76, the ORs (95% CI) were 2.41 (1.82-3.18) or 0.81 (0.53-1.25), respectively. Subgroup analysis showed no relationships of T2DM incidence with sex, BMI, family history of T2DM, or TG/HDL-C. TG/HDL-C is positively associated with diabetes risk. In our study, with each increasing quintile, the risk of T2DM after 4 years was 1.60 or 1.49 depending on the variables adjusted. In addition, our cohort study showed a nonlinear relationship between TG/HDL-C and T2DM incidence, with an inflection point of 1.76 or 1.50, depending on the variables adjusted. When the TG/HDL was less than 1.50, the ORs (95% CI) were 2.41 (1.82-3.18) and 2.50 (1.70-3.67). When the TG/HDL-C was greater than 1.76 or 1.50, there was no significant difference in the change in OR.}

However, the independent association between neighborhood poverty and incident HF remains understudied. To evaluate the association between neighborhood poverty and incident HF using a "real-world" clinical cohort. Retrospective cohort study of electronic health records from a large healthcare network. Individuals' residential addresses were geocoded at the census-tract level and categorized by poverty tertiles based on American Community Survey data (2007-2011). Patients from Northwestern Medicine who were 30-80 years, free of cardiovascular disease at index visit (January 1, 2005-December 1, 2013), and followed for at least 5 years. The association of neighborhood-level poverty tertile (low, intermediate, and high) and incident HF was analyzed using generalized linear mixed effect models adjusting for demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity) and HF risk factors (body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking status). Of 28,858 patients included, 75% were non-Hispanic (NH) White, 43% were men, 15% lived in a high-poverty neighborhood, and 522 (1.8%) were diagnosed with incident HF. High-poverty neighborhoods were associated with a 1.80 (1.35, 2.39) times higher risk of incident HF compared with low-poverty neighborhoods after adjustment for demographics and HF risk factors. In a large healthcare network, incident HF was associated with neighborhood poverty independent of demographic and clinical risk factors. Neighborhood-level interventions may be needed to complement individual-level strategies to prevent and curb the growing burden of HF.}

Compared to males, females had a longer duration of diabetes mellitus (9.1 ± 4.0 vs 8.0 ± 3.7 years), and were more likely to be obese (38% vs 34.4%), have hypertension (49.3% vs 45.7%) and have a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (75.0 ± 20.6 vs 77.4 ± 19.2 ml/min/1.73 m2). Females were less likely to smoke (2.8% vs 31.1%), and receive anti-platelets (53.5% vs 56%), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (31.7% vs 35.1%), and metformin (81.7% vs 85.4%). Females had a higher prevalence of CHD (9.9% vs 8.6%) and composite ASCVD (21.8% vs 18.9%). After adjustment for potential covariates, female sex remained independently associated with composite ASCVD (odds ratio [OR]: 1.21 and 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.57) and CHD (OR: 1.13 and 95% CI: 1.01-1.38).Conclusion: Among diabetic people, compared to males, females had a higher comorbid burden but received less optimal treatment, which might partly explain their higher prevalence of composite ASCVD and CHD.}

We explored the association between sex, gender, and cardiovascular health (CVH) among Canadian (CAN) and Austrian (AT) populations. The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) (n = 63,522; 55% female) and Austrian Health Interview Survey (AT-HIS) (n = 15,771; 56% female) were analyzed in a cross-sectional survey design. The CANHEART/ATHEART index, a measure of ideal CVH composed of 6 cardiometabolic risk factors (smoking, physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, overweight/obesity, diabetes, and hypertension; range 0-6; higher scores reflecting better CVH) was calculated for both databases. A composite measure of psychosociocultural gender was computed for each country (range 0-1, higher score identifying characteristics traditionally ascribed to women). Median CANHEART 4 (interquartile range 3-5) and CAN gender scores 0.55 (0.49-0.60) were similar to median ATHEART 4 (3-5) and AT gender scores 0.55 (0.46-0.64). Although higher gender scores (CCHS: β = -1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.44 to -1.22; AT-HIS: β = -1.08, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.89)) were associated with worse CVH, female sex (CCHS: β = 0.35, 95% CI (0.33-0.37); AT-HIS: β = 0.60, 95% CI (0.55-0.64)) was associated with better CVH in both populations. In addition, higher gender scores were associated with increased prevalence of heart disease compared with female sex. The magnitude of this risk was higher in Austrians. These results demonstrate that individuals with characteristics typically ascribed to women reported poorer cardiovascular health and higher risk of heart disease, independently from biological sex and baseline CV risk factors, in both countries. Female sex exhibited better CV health and a lower prevalence of heart disease than male in both populations. However, gender factors and magnitude of gender impact varied by country.}

However, other organs including the central nervous system (CNS) could be affected by the virus. Strokes, seizures, change in mental status, and encephalitis have been reported as the neurological manifestation of the disease. We hypothesized that COVID-19 could predispose younger patients to spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The present study aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 has any relationship with the occurrence of spontaneous ICH in young or not. We retrospectively evaluated all the patients with spontaneous ICH who were referred to our center between 20 Feb and 1 Sep 2020. The demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory test data were evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups. The COVID-19 positive patients and COVID-19 negative ones. All the variables including age, sex, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), hematoma volume and location, the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage and hydrocephalus on admission, the length of hospital stay, the lab test results and the clinical outcome at last visit or discharge as Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) were compared between the two groups. There were 22 COVID-19 positive patients (20.8%) and 84 COVID-19 negative ones (79.2%). The mean age of the patients in the case group (54.27 ± 4.67) was significantly lower than that in the control group (69.88 ± 4.47) (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, our results showed a significant difference between the two groups based on the presence of chronic arterial hypertension (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups based on gender, diabetes mellitus, smoking, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), hematoma volume, need for surgery, the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage and hydrocephalus on admission, White Blood Cell (WBC) count, platelet count, Prothrombin Time (PT), and Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) (p > 0.05). Our results show that COVID positive patients with ICH are younger and with less predisposing factors than COVID negative subjects with ICH.}

We modified the ATRIA score (ATRIA-HSV) by adding hyperlipidemia, smoking, and vascular disease and also male sex instead of female. We evaluated whether the CHA2DS2-VASc, CHA2DS2-VASc-HS, ATRIA, and ATRIA-HSV scores predict severe CAD. Consecutive patients with coronary angiography were prospectively included. A ≥50% stenosis in ≥1epicardial coronary artery (CA) was defined as severe CAD. Patient with normal CA (n = 210) were defined as group 1, with <50% CA stenosis (n = 178) as group 2, and with ≥50% stenosis (n = 297) as group 3. The mean ATRIA, ATRIA-HSV, CHA2DS2-VASc, and CHA2DS2VASc-HS scores increased from group 1 to group 3. A correlation was found between the Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery score and ATRIA (r = 0.570), ATRIA-HSV (r = 0.614), CHA2DS2-VASc (r = 0.428), and CHA2DS2-VASc-HS (r = 0.500) scores (Ps < .005). Pairwise comparisons of receiver operating characteristics curves showed that ATRIA-HSV (>3 area under curve [AUC]: 0.874) and ATRIA (>3, AUC: 0.854) have a better performance than CHA2DS2-VASc (>1, AUC: 0.746) and CHA2DS2-VASc-HS (>2, AUC: 0.769). In conclusion, the ATRIA and ATRIA-HSV scores are simple and may be useful to predict severe CAD.}

All patients underwent a head MRI examination within seven days following a head CT examination. The patients' demographics, medical history, presenting symptoms, and stroke location were recorded. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used to identify variables with a significant association with cerebral infarction. Cerebral infarction was detected in 79 (18%) patients confirmed by DWI(+), located mostly in the cerebellum (40.51%). Dizziness (85.19%) was the most common symptom. The cerebral infarction group showed a higher prevalence of hypertension (P<0.0001), diabetes mellitus (P<0.0001), and smoking status (P=0.001) than non-cerebral infarction group. The NLR (P<0.0001) was higher in the cerebral infarction group. There was no significant difference in NIHSS (P=0.09). Logistic analysis revealed that male gender (P=0.046), a history of hypertension (P=0.001), diabetes mellitus (P=0.001), smoking (P=0.023), and NLR (P<0.0001) were the best predictors of cerebral infarction. When integrating sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking and NLR, the area under ROC value of the combined method was 0.785, higher than any separate parameters (P<0.05). NLR combined with male gender, a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking, could predict DWI-confirmed cerebral infarction with nonfocal neurologic symptoms with high diagnostic accuracy.}

Visit-to-visit variability of HbA1c , SBP, albuminuria and eGFR was calculated as the SD of the residuals in individual linear regression models using all available measures in a specified period of 3 years (VV). Endpoints included were as follows: cardiovascular events (CVE) defined as myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or coronary or peripheral arterial intervention; end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) defined as eGFR <15 ml/min/1.73 m2 , chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation; eGFR decline ≥30%; and mortality. Adjustment included age, sex, cholesterol, HbA1c , SBP, body mass index, smoking, albuminuria, eGFR, and mean, intercept, slope of respective exposure variables and regression models. SBP VV was significantly associated with CVE (adjusted hazard ratio per 50% increase, (CI 95%); p: 1.21 [1.05-1.39]; p = 0.008), ESKD (1.51 [1.16-1.96]; p = 0.002) and mortality (1.25 [1.09-1.44]; p = 0.002).

We used a commercial database (Explorys, IBM Watson), which aggregates data from electronic health records from 26 major integrated healthcare systems in the United States. Fibromuscular dysplasia cases were identified using a unique systemized nomenclature of medical terminology (SNOMED CT) term. We calculated the overall and age-, race-, and sex-based prevalence of FMD, and evaluated sex and race-specific differences in manifestations. A total of 40,566,670 individuals were active in the database from January 2015 to January 2020. Of these, 4860 had a diagnosis of FMD with an overall prevalence of 12.0 cases per 100,000 individuals. The majority of patients with FMD were female (n=4130, 85.0%), Caucasian (n=3960, 80.5%) and adults aged 18 to 65 years (n=2610, 53.7%). FMD was more common in women (prevalence 18.4 per 100,000) than men (4.0 per 100,000) and among Caucasians (15.8 per 100,000) than African Americans (11.2 per 100,000). Men and African Americans with FMD were more likely to have traditional atherosclerotic risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, smoking, obesity, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease), and vascular manifestations (stroke, renal infarction, claudication), compared with women and Caucasians. Men with FMD were more likely to have dissection of aorta and renal artery as well as aneurysm of vertebral artery, coronary artery, aorta and iliac artery. African-Americans were more likely to have ruptured aortic aneurysms than Caucasians. The overall prevalence of FMD in this large aggregated electronic medical record study is estimated at 12.0 per 100,000 persons.

One hundred twenty-seven patients with a mean age of 68.6 (12.5) years were included. Three main clusters were identified. The first cluster associated young age, male sex, presence of patent foramen ovale, and posterior circulation infarct. The second phenotype linked hypertension, severe stroke, left atrial cardiopathy, diabetes mellitus, and involvement of multiple vascular territories. The third cluster gathered smoking, dyslipidemia, ipsilateral vulnerable sub-stenotic carotid plaque, and infarct of anterior vascular territory. Distinct clinical phenotypes have been identified within the ESUS population, which may supply clues to the underlying pathogenic mechanisms.}

We quantified the 5 year risk of cause-specific death in people with and without admission to hospital for severe hypoglycaemia, adjusting for potential confounders and accounting for competing risk. Of the 74,610 subjects included in the cohort, 388 (0.5%) were admitted at least once for a severe hypoglycaemic episode; subjects admitted were older, with higher HbA1c and a greater prevalence of multimorbidity. During a median follow-up of 7.1 years, 236 (60.8%) and 18,539 (25.0%) deaths occurred in subjects with and without a previous severe hypoglycaemia, respectively. Non-cardiovascular causes accounted for 71% of all deaths in both subjects with and without hypoglycaemia. In a 60-year-old person with severe hypoglycaemia, the 5 year absolute risk of death, adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, HbA1c, BMI, eGFR, smoking status, alcohol consumption and deprivation (Townsend score), was 6.6%, 1.1% and 13.1% for cardiovascular, cancer and other causes, respectively, while the 5 year absolute risk difference compared with a subject without severe hypoglycaemia was 4.7% (95% CI 1.0, 8.3) for cardiovascular, -1.4% (-4.1, 1.4) for cancer and 11.1% (6.1, 16.1) for other causes of death. Results were consistent in models further adjusted for medications and comorbidities (myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cancer), with sulfonylurea and insulin associated with increased mortality rates (from cause-specific hazard ratio of 1.06 [95% CI 0.99, 1.14] for cancer death with use of sulfonylurea to 1.42 [1.29, 1.56] for cardiovascular death with use of insulin). Results were robust to missing data. The results of this study indicate severe hypoglycaemia as a marker of, rather than causally linked to, an increased risk of long-term mortality. Regardless of the nature of the association, a severe hypoglycaemic episode represents a strong negative prognostic factor in patients with type 2 diabetes. Graphical abstract.}

  abstract = {Stroke incidence and mortality are declining rapidly in developed countries. Little data on ethnic-specific stroke recurrence trends exist. Fourteen-year stroke recurrence trend estimates were evaluated in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites in a population-based study. Recurrent stroke was ascertained prospectively in the population-based BASIC (Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi) project in Texas, between 2000 and 2013. Incident cases were followed forward to determine 1- and 2-year recurrence. Fine & Gray subdistribution hazard models were used to estimate adjusted trends in the absolute recurrence risk and ethnic differences in the secular trends. The ethnic difference in the secular trend was examined using an interaction term between index year and ethnicity in the models adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, atrial fibrillation, insurance, and cholesterol and relevant interaction terms. From January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2013 (N=3571), the cumulative incidence of 1-year recurrence in Mexican Americans decreased from 9.26% (95% CI, 6.9%-12.43%) in 2000 to 3.42% (95% CI, 2.25%-5.21%) in 2013. Among non-Hispanic whites, the cumulative incidence of 1-year recurrence in non-Hispanic whites decreased from 5.67% (95% CI, 3.74%-8.62%) in 2000 to 3.59% (95% CI, 2.27%-5.68%) in 2013. The significant ethnic disparity in stroke recurrence existed in 2000 (risk difference, 3.59% [95% CI, 0.94%-6.22%]) but was no longer seen by 2013 (risk difference, -0.17% [95% CI, -1.96% to 1.5%]). The competing 1-year mortality risk was stable over time among Mexican Americans, while for non-Hispanic whites it was decreasing over time (difference between 2000 and 2013: -4.67% [95% CI, -8.72% to -0.75%]). Mexican Americans had significant reductions in stroke recurrence despite a stable death rate, a promising indicator. The ethnic disparity in stroke recurrence present early in the study was gone by 2013.}

The National Inpatient Sample was utilized to identify hospitalized patients with a primary diagnosis of heat stroke from the years 2003-2014. Rhabdomyolysis was identified using hospital diagnosis code. We compared the clinical characteristics, in-hospital treatment, complications, outcomes, and resource utilization between patients with and without rhabdomyolysis. A total of 3,372 hospital admissions for heat stroke were studied. Of these, rhabdomyolysis occurred in 1049 (31%) admissions. The risk factors for rhabdomyolysis were age 20-39 years, male sex, African American race, history of alcohol drinking, whereas age ≥60 years, smoking, history of diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were associated with lower risk of rhabdomyolysis. Patients with rhabdomyolysis had greater requirements for mechanical ventilation, blood component transfusion, and renal replacement therapy. Rhabdomyolysis was significantly associated with increased risk of hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, serum phosphorus and magnesium derangement, metabolic acidosis, sepsis, ventricular arrhythmia or cardiac arrest, renal failure, respiratory failure, liver failure, neurological failure, hematologic failure, and in-hospital mortality. Length of hospital stay and hospitalization cost were higher when rhabdomyolysis occurred during hospital stay. Rhabdomyolysis occurred in about one-third of hospitalized patients for heat stroke and was associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and resource utilization.}

A total of 326 patients from the Greek APS registry [237 women, mean age 48.7 (13.4) years, 161 primary APS (PAPS), 165 SLE-APS] were age/sex matched (1:2 ratio) with 652 patients from a Greek multicentre RA cohort of 3115 patients. Prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, stroke, coronary artery disease (CAD), osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), depression and neoplasms were compared between APS and RA patients using multivariate regression analysis. Ηyperlipidemia and obesity (ΒΜΙ ≥ 30 kg/m2) were comparable while hypertension, smoking, stroke and CAD were more prevalent in APS compared with RA patients. Osteoporosis and depression were more frequent in APS, while DM, COPD and neoplasms did not differ between the two groups. Comparison of APS subgroups to 1:2 matched RA patients revealed that smoking and stroke were more prevalent in both PAPS and SLE-APS vs RA. Hypertension, CAD and osteoporosis were more frequent only in SLE-APS vs RA, whereas DM was less prevalent in PAPS vs RA. Hyperlipidaemia was independently associated with CV events (combined stroke and CAD) in PAPS and SLE-APS, while CS duration was associated with osteoporosis in SLE-APS. Comorbidity burden in APS (PAPS and SLE-APS) is comparable or higher than that in RA, entailing a high level of diligence for CV risk prevention, awareness for depression and CS exposure minimization.}

We examined the association of TMAO quartiles with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and the effect of TMAO on the efficacy of ticagrelor. Methods and Results PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin - Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54) randomized patients with prior myocardial infarction to ticagrelor or placebo (median follow-up 33 months). Baseline plasma concentrations of TMAO were measured in a nested case-control study of 597 cases with cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (MACE) and 1206 controls matched for age, sex, and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]. Odds ratios (OR) were used for the association between TMAO quartiles and MACE, adjusting for baseline clinical characteristics (age, sex, eGFR, region, body mass index, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, peripheral artery disease, index event, aspirin dosage and treatment arm), and cardiovascular biomarkers (hs-TnT [high-sensitivity troponin T], hs-CRP [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein], NT-proBNP [N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide]). Higher TMAO quartiles were associated with risk of MACE (OR for quartile 4 versus quartile 1, 1.43, 95% CI, 1.06-1.93, P trend=0.015). The association was driven by cardiovascular death (OR 2.25, 95% CI, 1.28-3.96, P trend=0.003) and stroke (OR 2.68, 95% CI, 1.39-5.17, P trend<0.001). After adjustment for clinical factors, the association persisted for cardiovascular death (ORadj 1.89, 95% CI, 1.03-3.45, P trend=0.027) and stroke (ORadj 2.01, 95% CI, 1.01-4.01, P trend=0.022), but was slightly attenuated after adjustment for cardiovascular biomarkers (cardiovascular death: ORadj 1.74, 95% CI, 0.88-3.45, P trend=0.079; and stroke: ORadj 1.82, 95% CI, 0.88-3.78, P trend=0.056). The reduction in MACE with ticagrelor was consistent across TMAO quartiles (P interaction=0.92). Conclusions Among patients with prior myocardial infarction, higher TMAO levels were associated with cardiovascular death and stroke but not with recurrent myocardial infarction. The efficacy of ticagrelor was consistent regardless of TMAO levels. Registration URL: https://www.clini​caltr​ials.gov; Unique identifiers: PEGASUS-TIMI 54, NCT01225562.}

One hundred and fifty-four ACI patients who previously received aspirin therapy (100 mg/day) were enrolled. Whole urine (for measuring 11dhTXB2 and creatinine) along with blood (for measuring the plasma 4-HNE level) were collected at least 7 days after the patients received aspirin. A cutoff of 1500 pg/mg of 11dhTXB2/ creatinine was used to determine AR. A follow-up period to monitor recurrence CI events was 1 year. In addition, blood testing was performed when the patients were first admitted to hospital. Forty-six of the 154 enrolled patients (29.9%) were found to be AR. No statistical difference in age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary disease, smoking status, NIHSS score, TOAST classification, platelet count, thrombocytocrit, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, and TC was found between the AR and aspirin-sensitive (AS) patients, but the plasma 4-HNE level was found to be higher in the AR patients than AS patients (p < .05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the 4-HNE level was associated with a higher risk of AR (OR = 1.034; 95% CI = 1.011-1.058; p < .05). Moreover, 1-year follow-up showed that AR was more prevalent in patients with recurrent CI (26 (56.6%)) than those without (20/(43.5%)) (p < .001). The plasma 4-HNE level is strongly associated with AR and thus may be a factor contributing to AR. Patients with AR have a greater risk of recurrence CI.}

Data on the modifiable factors contributing to the recurrence of stroke in type 2 diabetic Malaysian population with a history of stroke stratified by genders are lacking, and this supports the importance of this study. The data of 4622 patients with T2DM who had a history of stroke was obtained from the Malaysian National Stroke Registry. Univariate analysis was performed to differentiate between genders with and without stroke recurrence in terms of demographics, first stroke attack presentations, and other clinical characteristics. The significant factors determined from the univariate analysis were further investigated using logistic regression. Ischemic heart diseases were found significantly associated with the stroke recurrence in males (OR = 1.738; 95% CI: 1.071-2.818) as well as female (OR = 5.859; 95% CI: 2.469-13.752) diabetic patients. The duration of hypertension, as well as the duration of diabetes, has been associated with the recurrence in both male and female subjects (p value < 0.05). Smoking status has an impact on the stroke recurrence in male subjects, while no significant association was observed among their peers. Most of the predictive factors contributing to the recurrence of stroke in type 2 diabetic Malaysian population with a history of stroke are modifiable, in which IHD was the most prominent risk factor in both genders. The impact of optimizing the management of IHD as well as blood glucose control on stroke recurrence may need to be elucidated. No major differences in recurrent stroke predictors were seen between genders among the Malaysian population with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had a previous history of stroke.}

Risks factors of mortality were identified using bivariate analysis and logistic regression modeling. A total of 40,800 patients satisfied the study inclusion criteria. The findings of the logistic regression model for mortality using the covariates age, sex, race, SBP, ISS, ACS trauma level, smoking status, CKD, CVA, DM, and HTN were associated with a higher risk of mortality (p < .05). The fitted model had an Area under the Curve (AUC) measure of 0.75. Cases of geriatric patients who look normal after a fall from ground level at home can still be associated with higher risk of in-hospital death, particularly those who are older, male, have certain comorbidities. These higher-risk patients should be triaged to the hospital with proper evaluation and management.}

  abstract = {The main objective of this research was to evaluate the association of insulin resistance (IR) with micro- and macrovascular complications, sex hormones, and other clinical data. Cross-sectional study of patients older than 18 years old with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) was performed. Participants filled in questionnaires about T1D, disease duration, smoking, glycemic control, chronic diabetes complications, and hypertension status. Data about chronic diabetic complications (neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy) were collected from medical records. History of major cardiovascular events such as angina, myocardial infarction, and stroke were collected from medical records also. Laboratory tests including creatinine, cholesterol levels, testosterone (T), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), estradiol levels, and albumin in 24-h urine sample were performed. IR was calculated using the following formula: estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) = 24.31 - [12.22 × waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)] - [3.29 ×  hypertension status (defined as 0 = no, 1 = yes)] - [0.57 × glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)]. The data was considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. A total of 200 people (mean age 39.9 ± 12.1 years) with T1D were included in the study. Patients with T1D were analyzed according to eGDR levels stratified by tertiles. The cutoff value of eGDR which reflects IR was less than 6.4 mg kg-1 min-1. When eGDR was less than 6.4 mg kg-1 min-1, diabetes microvascular complications occurred significantly more often (p < 0.001); the cutoff of eGDR for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events was less than 2.34 mg kg-1 min-1. Lower eGDR, longer diabetes duration, and lower HbA1c significantly increased CVD outcomes risk. eGDR was also significantly lower in smokers (7.3 ± 2.5 vs. non-smokers 8.2 ± 2.6, p = 0.011), the obese (lean 8.25 ± 2.47 vs. obese 5.36 ± 2.74, p < 0.000), older patients (less than 50 years 8.0 ± 2.5 vs. more than 50 years 6.2 ± 2.8, p = 0.001), men (men 6.4 ± 2.4 vs. women 8.7 ± 2.2, p < 0.001), patients with long-standing diabetes (< 10 years 7.3 ± 2.6 vs. > 10 years 8.7 ± 2.3, p < 0.001), and chronic diabetes complications (diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy, p < 0.001), and patients with CVD (with CVD 5.5 ± 2.4 vs. no CVD 8.0 ± 2.4, p < 0.001). Patients with T1D and a family history of T2D were not susceptible to weight gain during intensive insulin treatment. Metabolic syndrome (MS) phenotype prevalence, including and dyslipidemia rate, were higher in the obese group than in normal weight, but a clear difference was not seen (p = 0.07). Positive linear correlation between men's T and eGDR level was observed (r = 0.33, p = 0.04), i.e., men with higher testosterone level had better insulin sensitivity. Other parameters (like T in women, estrogens, SHBG) did not show any significant association with eGDR. According to stratified eGDR, IR was found for one-third of the current T1D population. Insulin resistant patients more frequently had microvascular complications and CVD events. Lower eGDR, longer diabetes duration, and lower HbA1c significantly increased CVD outcomes risk. IR was related to smoking, obesity, gender, age, and diabetes duration. Moreover, men's testosterone had a positive correlation with IR in T1D. Finally, patients with T1D and a positive family history of T2D were not susceptible to weight gain, while MS metabolic phenotype prevalence tended to be higher in obese than in lean patients with T1D, with a tendency to significant difference.}

Routine ingestion by hypertensive patients of ≥1 prescribed BP-lowering medications at bedtime, as opposed to upon waking, results in improved ABP control (significantly enhanced decrease in asleep BP and increased sleep-time relative BP decline, i.e. BP dipping) and, most importantly, markedly diminished occurrence of major CVD events.

  abstract = {Several independent randomized controlled trials have shown superior efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for management of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, elderly patients have been underrepresented or excluded in these trials. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility and safety of MT in patients with AIS ≥90 years old. A retrospective review was performed of patients ≥90 years old presenting with AIS who underwent MT between 2010 and 2018. Of 453 patients with AIS, 5.74% (n = 26) were ≥90 years old, and 69.32% (n = 314) were 60-89 years old. Of baseline characteristics between both groups, there was a significant difference in age, sex, body mass index, smoking, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus. Mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission was higher in the nonagenarians (17 vs. 15). Similar proportions of both groups received tissue plasminogen activator, 57.69% (n = 15) versus 42.68% (n = 134), P = 0.14). There was no difference in periprocedural and postprocedural complications, good Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction scores (88.46% [n = 23] vs. 87.58% [n = 275], P = 1.00), good modified Rankin Scale scores (34.62% [n = 4] vs. 49.36% [n = 155], P = 0.40), or mortality (11.54% [n = 3] vs. 13.06% [n = 41], P = 0.82). Age is a factor that affects functional outcome following MT. Advancements in catheter techniques, technical experience, and great outcomes with MT allow for pushing the boundaries to consider age as one factor, rather than an exclusion criterion. Our results show that MT is safe and feasible in nonagenarians.}

  abstract = {Data on the sex-specific differences in risk of stroke among patients with H-type hypertension are limited. We aimed to analyze interactions between sex and other risk factors on stroke, including the sex-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) interaction. A retrospective analysis of baseline data from 2040 patients with hypertension and hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) included demographic characteristics, biomarkers, history of chronic diseases and lifestyle factors. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method was used to investigate the C677T polymorphism of MTHFR gene. We examined independent effects and interactions between sex and stratified factors on the risk of stroke by logistic regression model. A total of 1412 patients suffered stroke, and the prevalence of stroke was 70.65% in men and 66.53% in women. Both men and women had independent risk factors for stroke, including diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, smoking, increased level of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and plasma total homocysteine (tHcy), as well as the decreased level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) -specific risk of stroke was unique to men. Interactions between sex and other risk factors on stroke risk were statistically significant: age, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), SBP, DBP, triglycerides (TG) and tHcy. Furthermore, tHcy interacted with age, SBP and DBP in men, and age, SBP, DBP, FPG, and TG in women to modulate the risk of stroke. Although TT genotype did not have an independent effect on stroke, it could interact with sex and FPG, TG and SBP to increase stroke. In conclusion, sex-specific differences are useful to stratify the risk of stroke and assist clinicians in the decision to select a reasonable therapeutic option for high-risk patients.}

These patients underwent prospective assessment and classification of regadenoson-induced side-effects in six categories and recording of heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) before and after regadenoson administration. From this initial population, after adjustment with 1:1 propensity matching using gender as the dependent variable and age, BMI, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, presence of coronary artery disease, LVEF, baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and HR, on-going use of cardio-active medications during test, and abnormal MPI scan as independent variables, a population of 279 pairs of opposite gender was formed and studied. Compared with men, women had a significantly higher rate of any side-effect (71% vs. 58%, p = 0.002), chest pain (23% vs. 12%, p < 0.001), gastrointestinal discomfort (20% vs. 12%, p = 0.01), dizziness (12% vs. 5%, p = 0.002), and headache (20% vs. 13%, p = 0.03) and similar rates of dyspnea and other side-effects. Women demonstrated a higher median HR-response compared with men (41% (- 8, 127) vs. 34% (- 5, 106), p = 0.001) while men demonstrated a lower median systolic BP response (- 3% (- 27, 48) vs. 0% (- 36, 68), p = 0.02) compared with women. Gender is independently associated with a differential response to regadenoson with regard to overall side-effects and HR-response. These observations have the potential of important management and prognostic implications respectively.}

Clinical trials suggest that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω3 PUFAs) prevent sudden death in coronary heart disease and HF, but this is controversial. In mice, the authors demonstrated that the ω3 PUFA EPA prevents contractile dysfunction and fibrosis in an HF model, but whether this extends to humans is unclear. In the MESA cohort, the authors tested if plasma phospholipid EPA predicts primary HF incidence, including HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF) (EF <45%) and HF with preserved EF (EF ≥45%) using Cox proportional hazards modeling. A total of 6,562 participants 45 to 84 years of age had EPA measured at baseline (1,794 black, 794 Chinese, 1,442 Hispanic, and 2,532 white; 52% women). Over a median follow-up period of 13.0 years, 292 HF events occurred: 128 HF with reduced EF, 110 HF with preserved EF, and 54 with unknown EF status. %EPA in HF-free participants was 0.76% (0.75% to 0.77%) but was lower in participants with HF at 0.69% (0.64% to 0.74%) (p = 0.005). Log %EPA was associated with lower HF incidence (hazard ratio: 0.73 [95% confidence interval: 0.60 to 0.91] per log-unit difference in %EPA; p = 0.001). Adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking, diabetes mellitus, blood pressure, lipids and lipid-lowering drugs, albuminuria, and the lead fatty acid for each cluster did not change this relationship. Sensitivity analyses showed no dependence on HF type. Higher plasma EPA was significantly associated with reduced risk for HF, with both reduced and preserved EF.

We investigate gender differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes in ischemic stroke patients with high-grade ICA stenosis. Three-hundred and seventy-two acute ischemic stroke patients with high-grade ICA stenosis were enrolled and followed up for 5 years. Demographic features, vascular risk factors, co-morbidities, and outcomes were compared between male and female genders. Two-hundred and seventy-three (73.4%) patients were males and 99 (26.6%) patients were females. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation was higher in females (P = 0.031 and P = 0.043), whereas the prevalence of smoking was higher in males (P < 0.001). The 5-year mortality rate was not different between males and females (P = 0.437), whereas the 5-year recurrent stroke rate was significantly higher in males (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.22-3.75; P = 0.004). After adjusting for the established clinical predictors of adverse outcomes, the multivariate Cox regression revealed that male gender is a significant predictor of recurrent ischemic stroke (HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.19-3.20; P = 0.008). In conclusion, male gender is associated with increased risk of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with high-grade ICA stenosis during 5-year follow-up. Further prospective trial to assess whether male gender may benefit from more aggressive vascular risk factors control and treatment strategies for stroke prevention is warranted.}

Methods and Results We analyzed mortality data submitted to the World Health Organization from 2005 to 2015 by individual countries. We explored patterns in relationships with age, sex, and income and calculated age-standardized mortality rates for each country in addition to crude death rates. In 5 illustrative countries which provided detailed data, we analyzed trends of mortality from IHD and 3 noncommunicable diseases (lung cancer, stroke, and chronic lower respiratory tract diseases) and examined the simultaneous trends in important cardiovascular risk factors. Russia, United States, and Ukraine had the largest absolute numbers of deaths among the countries that provided data. Among 5 illustrative countries (United Kingdom, United States, Brazil, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine), IHD was the top cause of death, but mortality from IHD has progressively decreased from 2005 to 2015. Age-standardized IHD mortality rates per 100 000 people per year were much higher in Ukraine (324) and Kazakhstan (97) than in United States (60), Brazil (54), and the United Kingdom (46), with much less difference in other causes of death. All 5 countries showed a progressive decline in IHD mortality, with a decline in smoking and hypertension and in all cases a rise in obesity and type II diabetes mellitus. Conclusions IHD remains the single largest cause of death in countries of all income groups. Rates are different between countries and are falling in most countries, indicating great potential for further gains. On the horizon, future improvements may become curtailed by increasing hypertension in some developing countries and more importantly global growth in obesity.}

  abstract = {The pattern of stroke in rural population differs from that in urban ones. Although there are many studies on this condition in sub-Saharan Africa, few studies about stroke pattern in a Kenyan rural area exist.. This study therefore aims at describing the characteristics of stroke in a rural Kenyan hospital. The study was conducted on 227 consecutive patients admitted with a World Health Organization (WHO) diagnosis of stroke in Kangundo Hospital, a level IV facility in Machakos, Eastern Kenya, between April 2015 and September 2016. The sub-type and anatomical distribution of stroke as well as the age, gender of the patients were recorded prospectively. Diagnosis was made through physical neurological examination and confirmed by Computerized Tomography (CT) scan imaging. Only those with complete bio-data, past medical and social history, clinical and physical findings of the patients and imaging results were included. The data were entered into a pre-formatted questionnaire, analysed for means, standard deviations and frequencies, and are presented in tables and bar charts. Out of 3200 medical admissions, 227 (7.09%) had a confirmed diagnosis of stroke. Ischaemic stroke was more common (67.4%) than haemorrhagic stroke (32.6%). It affected mainly the anterior circulation, especially the middle cerebral artery (39%). The mean age of patients was 68.8 years, (Range 32-96). It was more common in females (62%) than in males (38%). Hypertension was the most common (74%) risk factor followed by alcohol abuse (63%), tobacco smoking (48%) and diabetes mellitus (42%). Ischaemic stroke was the more common major cause of morbidity in the rural hospital studied in Kenya. It occurred most commonly among elderly females, with the most frequent comorbidities being hypertension. In addition, modifiable lifestyle factors like alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking contributed to the prevalence; hence we recommend the control of blood pressure and glucose as well as lifestyle modification to reduce the scourge in our studied population.}

By collecting information and screening the data, patients with ischemic stroke were obtained and a control group with similar gender, age, and regional distribution was selected among the nonischemic stroke patients. Then, the demographic and risk factors of patients with ischemic stroke were described and analyzed.The prevalence of ischemic stroke in northern China was 2.88%, with a greater prevalence in rural areas than in urban areas (3.32% vs 2.43%), and a greater prevalence in males than in females (3.06% vs 2.73%). Furthermore, rural stroke patients were younger than urban stroke patients. Hypertension, family history of stroke, and smoking were the top 3 independent risk factors for ischemic stroke. Overweight/obesity and low education were associated with increased ischemic stroke in urban areas, while low education was associated with less ischemic stroke in rural areas. In addition, the prevalence of alcoholism, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and obvious overweight/obesity was greater in urban areas, while high-salt diet and low education and income were more prevalent in rural regions. Moreover, the smoking index was higher in rural areas than in urban areas.The characteristics and risk factors of ischemic stroke differ between rural and urban areas, which could be used to design specific preventative measures.}

Methods- Ischemic stroke cases from 2008 to 2015 from the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi project in Texas were followed prospectively for 3 months poststroke to assess medication adherence. Medications in 5 drug classes were analyzed: statins, antiplatelets, anticoagulants, antihypertensives, and antidepressants. For each drug class, patients were considered adherent if they reported never missing a dose in a typical week. The χ2 tests or Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric tests were used for ethnic comparisons of demographics, risk factors, and medication adherence. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed for the association of ethnicity and medication nonadherence. Results- Mexican Americans (n=692) were younger (median 65 years versus 68 years, P<0.001), had more diabetes mellitus ( P<0.001) and hypertension ( P<0.001) and less atrial fibrillation ( P=0.003), smoking ( P=0.003), and education ( P<0.001) than non-Hispanic whites (n=422). Sex, insurance status, high cholesterol, previous stroke/transient ischemic attack history, excessive alcohol use, tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator) treatment, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and comorbidity index did not significantly differ by ethnicity. There was no significant difference in medication adherence for any of the 5 drug classes between Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Conclusions- This study did not find ethnic differences in medication adherence, thus challenging this patient-level factor as an explanation for stroke recurrence disparities. Other reasons for the excessive stroke recurrence burden in Mexican Americans, including provider and health system factors, should be explored.}

Materials and methods: We retrospectively examined both clinical and imaging results of 40 stroke patients with PFO and 29 with SIAD. To reduce selection bias, we conducted a propensity score-matching analysis. The patients' propensity scores were estimated using a logistic regression model based on the following variables: age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking, stroke histories, and their NIHSS scores. We compared the pattern of cerebral DWI lesions between patients with PFO and those with SIAD. Results: After propensity score matching, 21 pairs of patients were selected. Clinical characteristics of the 2 groups were well matched. The distribution of DWI lesion patterns differed between the 2 groups. Single lesions (cortical or subcortical) were more frequently observed in the PFO group than in the SIAD group (P = 0.026). Multiple lesions in one vascular territory occurred more frequently in the SIAD group than in the PFO group (P = 0.035). Conclusion: The present study suggests that lesion patterns observed from DWI of patients with PFO and SIAD might provide clues to the etiology of infarcts. Single lesions (cortical or subcortical) might be a typical feature of PFO associated strokes, while multiple lesions in one vascular territory might be a specific feature of SIAD associated strokes.}

Readily available patient characteristics were included in Fine and Gray competing risk models (sex, age, smoking, antiplatelet drugs, previous vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and hemoglobin). Five-year risks for ischemic stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding were estimated without anticoagulation therapy, and compared with high- and low-dose dabigatran. Model calibration was good, and discrimination was adequate with a c-statistic of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.62-0.70) for ischemic stroke/systemic embolism and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.66-0.71) for major bleeding. The 5-year absolute risk reduction for ischemic stroke/systemic embolism with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily ranged from <10% in 20% of patients to >25% in 14% of patients, and the 5-year absolute risk increase for major bleeding ranged from <5% in 53% of patients to 15% to 20% in 1% of patients. Comparing high-dose to low-dose dabigatran, the net benefit (absolute risk reduction minus absolute risk increase) was positive for 46% of patients. The absolute treatment benefits and harms of dabigatran in atrial fibrillation can be estimated based on readily available patient characteristics. Such treatment effect estimations can be used for shared decision making before starting dabigatran treatment and to determine the optimal dose. URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

In this prospective cohort study, 2439 Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome or stable coronary artery disease undergoing coronary stent implantation and receiving clopidogrel and aspirin were consecutively recruited. Their platelet reactivity was determined by light transmission aggregometry at 5 and 30 days after coronary intervention. Genotyping was performed using an improved multiplex ligation detection reaction technique. All patients completed a 30-day follow-up for clinical outcomes. Genotyping for PEAR1 showed 768 (38.3%) GG homozygotes, 941 (46.9%) GA heterozygotes, and 298 (14.8%) AA homozygotes. The 30-day incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events, the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke were significantly higher in AA homozygotes than in non-AA homozygotes (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.13-6.82; P=0.026), irrespective of CYP2C19*2 loss-of-function polymorphism and known outcome predictors including age, sex, smoking, and diabetes mellitus. The ADP-induced platelet aggregation was significantly lower in AA homozygotes than that in GG homozygotes at both time points, although no significant difference was found for the arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation among the 3 groups. About 15% of Chinese patients undergoing coronary stent implantation were AA homozygotes for PEAR1 rs12041331. These patients had ≈3-fold increase in short-term major adverse cardiovascular events risk compared with non-AA homozygotes, and the adverse clinical outcome is unlikely to be mediated by suboptimal pharmacological response to aspirin or clopidogrel.

Methods- The MESA is a prospective cohort study of 6814 adults from 4 ethnic groups (European-, Asian-, African- and Hispanic-American) with a mean age of 62 (±10.2) years and an average of 11.7 (±2.2) years of follow-up. Participants were free of clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline. Spot urine sodium and potassium excretion, as a marker of dietary intake, was collected at baseline. The impact of urinary sodium-to-potassium ratio on adjudicated cardiovascular events was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Results- Only 39% of MESA participants had a urinary sodium-to-potassium ratio ≤1, and these participants experienced only 74 of the 236 strokes. A sodium-to-potassium ratio >1 was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.47 (95% CI,1.07-2.00) for risk of stroke, adjusting for age, sex, race, cardiovascular risk factors, socio-demographic characteristics, body size, and kidney function. Conclusions- The spot urine sodium-to-potassium ratio (measurable in routine care) is associated with stroke. A urine sodium-to-potassium ratio of ≤1, may be related to a clinically relevant reduction in stroke risk and is a feasible target for health interventions.}

  abstract = {Although group-level effectiveness of lipid, blood pressure, glucose, and aspirin treatment for prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been proven by trials, important differences in absolute effectiveness exist between individuals. We aim to develop and validate a prediction tool for individualizing lifelong CVD prevention in people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) predicting life-years gained without myocardial infarction or stroke. We developed and validated the Diabetes Lifetime-perspective prediction (DIAL) model, consisting of two complementary competing risk adjusted Cox proportional hazards functions using data from people with T2DM registered in the Swedish National Diabetes Registry (n = 389 366). Competing outcomes were (i) CVD events (vascular mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke) and (ii) non-vascular mortality. Predictors were age, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, haemoglobin A1c, estimated glomerular filtration rate, non- high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, albuminuria, T2DM duration, insulin treatment, and history of CVD. External validation was performed using data from the ADVANCE, ACCORD, ASCOT and ALLHAT-LLT-trials, the SMART and EPIC-NL cohorts, and the Scottish diabetes register (total n = 197 785). Predicted and observed CVD-free survival showed good agreement in all validation sets. C-statistics for prediction of CVD were 0.83 (95% confidence interval: 0.83-0.84) and 0.64-0.65 for internal and external validation, respectively. We provide an interactive calculator at www.U-Prevent.com that combines model predictions with relative treatment effects from trials to predict individual benefit from preventive treatment. Cardiovascular disease-free life expectancy and effects of lifelong prevention in terms of CVD-free life-years gained can be estimated for people with T2DM using readily available clinical characteristics. Predictions of individual-level treatment effects facilitate translation of trial results to individual patients.}

  abstract = {Currently, there are a lot of studies on gender-related risk factors for stroke. However, contradictory data and the lack of a common view on the problem of gender-based approach to stroke prevention determine the importance of this problem. The most significant sex-non-specific stroke risk factors are hypertension, cardiac conditions, including atrial fibrillation, smoking, glucose and lipid metabolism disorders, excessive alcohol consumption, overweight, low physical activity and sedentary lifestyle, emotional stress. However, the incidence and significance of each stroke risk factor in women are different compared with men, due to women's reproductive status. Hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, abdominal obesity, migraine with aura, emotional stress and depression are more common risk factors in women compared to men. The stroke risk factors unique to women are the timing of age at menarche, pregnancy, gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, hormonal status disturbances, the use of combined oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy. В статье представлена проблема гендерно-ориентированного подхода к профилактике инсульта. Рассматриваются наиболее значимые факторы риска развития инсульта как неспецифичные для пола, так и в сравнении для мужчин и женщин. Показано, что у женщин, учитывая их репродуктивный статус, отмечается иная, чем у мужчин, частота и значимость факторов риска развития инсульта. В настоящее время имеется большое количество исследований, посвященных изучению особенностей факторов риска развития инсульта у мужчин и женщин. Однако противоречивые данные литературы, отсутствие единого взгляда на проблему гендерно-ориентированного подхода к профилактике инсульта определяет актуальность поставленной проблемы. Наиболее значимыми неспецифичными для пола факторами риска развития инсульта являются: артериальная гипертензия, заболевания сердца, в том числе фибрилляция предсердий, курение, нарушения углеводного и липидного обмена, чрезмерное потребление алкоголя, избыточная масса тела, низкая физическая активность и малоподвижный образ жизни, эмоциональный стресс. Однако у женщин, учитывая их репродуктивный статус, отмечается иная, чем у мужчин, частота и значимость факторов риска. К факторам риска развития инсульта, чаще встречающимся у женщин, чем у мужчин, относятся: АГ, фибрилляция предсердий, сахарный диабет, абдоминальное ожирение, мигрень с аурой, эмоциональный стресс и депрессия. Исключительно для женщин характерны такие факторы, как возраст наступления менархе, беременность, гестационный сахарный диабет, преэклампсия, изменение гормонального статуса, применение комбинированных оральных контрацептивов и заместительной гормональной терапии.}

  abstract = {Previous studies found regional differences in the prevalence and incidence of type 2 diabetes between Northeast and South of Germany. The aim of this study was to investigate if regional variations are also present for macrovascular disease in people with type 2 diabetes and in the general population. A further aim was to investigate if traditional risk factors of macrovascular complications can explain these regional variations. Data of persons aged 30-79 from two regional population-based studies, SHIP-TREND (Northeast Germany, 2008-2012, n = 2539) and KORA-F4 (South Germany, 2006-2008, n = 2932), were analysed. Macrovascular disease was defined by self-reported previous myocardial infarction, stroke or coronary angiography. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for prevalence of macrovascular disease in persons with type 2 diabetes and in the general population. The prevalence of macrovascular disease in persons with type 2 diabetes and in the general population was considerably higher in the Northeast (SHIP-TREND: 32.8 and 12.0%) than in the South of Germany (KORA-F4: 24.9 and 8.8%), respectively. The odds of macrovascular disease in persons with type 2 diabetes was 1.66 (95% CI: 1.11-2.49) in the Northeast in comparison to the South after adjustment for sex, age, body mass index, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking. In the general population, SHIP-TREND participants also had a significantly increased odds of macrovascular disease compared to KORA-F4 participants (OR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.33-2.00). After excluding coronary angiography (myocardial infarction or stroke only), the ORs for region decreased in all models, but the difference between SHIP-TREND and KORA-F4 participants was still significant in the age- and sex-adjusted model for the general population (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.01-1.78). This study provides an indication for regional differences in macrovascular disease, which is not explained by traditional risk factors. Further examinations of other risk factors, such as regional deprivation or geographical variations in medical care services are needed.}

  abstract = {Background: The authors analyzed data from the Hungarian Myocardial Infarction Registry (HUMIR) to examine the potential impact of gender on the treatment and 30-day and 1-year mortality of patients with myocardial infarction (MI). Materials and Methods: The National Registry of Myocardial Infarction included 42,953 patients between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2016; 19,875 of whom were diagnosed with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and 23,078 with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The proportion of women was 39% and 41.9% in the two groups, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was performed adjusting for age, the year and month of hospital admission, smoking, as well as for five concomitant diseases and anamnestic data. We found that the odds ratio (OR) of performing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was influenced by age, the year of treatment, prior stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD) in both patient groups. Results: Gender had an impact on treatment in both cases; women had significantly fewer PCIs (OR = 0.86 confidence interval [95% CI: 0.77-0.95] in the STEMI group, OR = 0.75 [95% CI: 0.70-0.82] in the NSTEMI group). Age and PCI, PAD, and diabetes mellitus proved to be prognostic factors for 30-day and 1-year mortality in both groups. In the STEMI group, hypertension proved to be of prognostic value for both 30-day and 1-year mortality, whereas prior MI, stroke, and smoking only affected 1-year mortality. Similarly, in the NSTEMI group, prior stroke was also of prognostic value for 30-day and 1-year mortality, whereas prior MI, hypertension and smoking were only associated with 1-year mortality. Conclusions: The independent prognostic value of gender could not be proven for any of the MI types or follow-up periods. In conclusion, gender influenced the treatment of patients with MI but had no significant impact on prognosis in itself.}

The study included 4506 individuals with type 1 diabetes who were participating in the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy (FinnDiane) study. Intensity of smoking was estimated by packs per day and cumulative smoking by pack-years. Cox regression analyses were used to estimate the risk of incident CHD, heart failure or stroke during follow-up. One pack per day significantly increased the risk of incident CHD in current smokers compared with never smokers (HR 1.45 [95% CI 1.15, 1.84]), after adjustment for age, sex, HbA1c, hypertension, duration of diabetes and BMI. The risk of CHD in former smokers was similar to the risk in never smokers. The risk of incident heart failure was 1.43 (95% CI 1.03, 1.97) in current smokers per one pack per day and 1.37 (95% CI 1.05, 1.77) in former smokers, while the risk of incident stroke was 1.70 (95% CI 1.26, 2.29) and 1.49 (95% CI 1.14, 1.93), respectively. After further adjustments for lipids, however, the difference in the risk of heart failure in current and former smokers was no longer significant. Cumulative smoking data were similar to smoking intensity data. There is a dose-dependent association between smoking and cardiovascular disease in individuals with type 1 diabetes. In men in particular, the risk of incident stroke remains high even after smoking cessation and is increased in current and former smokers independently of other risk factors.}

We identified adults with diabetes from the Southern California and Pacific Northwest regions of Kaiser Permanente. We included patients undergoing statin therapy with LDL-C from 40-100 mg/dL who were not undergoing other lipid-lowering therapies and had a prior diagnosis of atherosclerotic CVD or at least one other CVD risk factor. We grouped patients into high TG (200-499 mg/dL; n = 5542) or normal TG (<150 mg/dL, n = 22 411) from January 2010 through December 2016 to compare incidence rates and rate ratios of first non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, unstable angina and coronary revascularization. We adjusted multivariable analyses for age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status, blood pressure, HbA1c, serum creatinine, presence of ischaemic heart disease and study site. Adjusted rate ratios for the four outcomes were all statistically significantly different. The incidence rate for non-fatal MI was 30% higher in the high TG group (rate ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.08-1.58; P = 0.006). The rate was 23% higher for non-fatal stroke (1.23, 1.01-1.49, P = 0.037), 21% higher for coronary revascularization (rate ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02-1.43; P = 0.027) and was, non-significantly, 33% higher for unstable angina (rate ratio, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.87-2.03; P = 0.185). Despite statin-controlled LDL-C levels, CV events were greater among patients with diabetes and high TG levels. Because we controlled for cardiometabolic risk factors, it is likely that the difference in TG levels contributed to the excess risk observed in patients with high TGs.}

A stepwise logistic regression for odds ratio (OR) was performed to identify the effects of risk factors on occurrence of VAOD. Of 56 patients with VAOD (mean age ± standard deviation [SD]; 65.4 ± 11.7years, 44.6% women), 37.5% were classified as suffering from moderate stenosis (50%-69%), 16.1% from severe stenosis (70%-99%), and 46.4% from occlusion of at least 1 vertebral artery.

Severity of stenosis and bilateral involvement were associated with symptomatic VAOD. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and active cigarette smoking were associated with occurrence of VAOD.}

Clinical features and risk factors were recorded. The mortality, recurrence, and dependency rates at 3 months after stroke were assessed. A total of 2524 patients with SAO were included in this study. There was a higher frequency of mild stroke, current smoking, and alcohol consumption in men than in women. Women were more likely than men to be older, to have diabetes and obesity, and to have higher total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. There were worse outcomes in men than in women at 3 months after stroke (P < 0.05). There were more independent risk factors of poor outcome in men than in women. Older age was a common predictive factor of outcome both in men and in women. In men, low triglyceride levels and high fasting plasma glucose levels were independent risk factors for mortality; in addition, a high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was associated with recurrence. Moreover, in men, moderate and severe stroke, and high total cholesterol and fasting plasma glucose levels were risk factors for dependency. A negative association was found between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and risk of mortality and between total cholesterol level and risk of recurrence in women. These findings suggest that it is crucial to control conventional risk factors and fasting plasma glucose and lipid levels among patients with SAO, especially male patients, to reduce the burden of stroke in China.}

A structured customized diabetic foot data collection form with diabetic foot characteristics chart was used for documentation of relevant information, which checks for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, duration of diabetes, diabetic control therapy, associated hypertension, cardiac diseases, stroke, chronic renal impairment, renal replacement therapy (hem-dialysis), and history of diabetes-related complication in both feet prior to the study period. The predictors for major lower limb amputations were compared between groups using chi-square test, and binary logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with major amputation. Twenty-seven limbs underwent major amputations with an overall rate of major amputation of 11.6%. The following predictors were found to be associated with the higher incidence of major lower limb amputations: duration of diabetes ≥15 years, HbA1c ≥8%, patients on insulin, with hypertension, cardiac diseases, chronic renal impairment, stroke, having gangrene, higher number of components, higher Wagner classification, and ischemia. However, the rate did not differ significantly between men and women. Presentation with gangrenous tissue and poor glycemic control are the important risks and significant predictive factors for type 2 diabetes-related major lower limb amputations.}

A cross-sectional study was carried out including 501 Lebanese adults (64.3% women) from the Greater Beirut area using random multistage probability sampling. Interviews, physical exams, and blood withdrawal were conducted to collect information on demographic and lifestyle factors, body mass index, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, blood lipids, as well as history of coronary artery diseases, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, dyslipidemia, and stroke. Means with SD for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables are reported. The prevalence CVD risk factors including obesity, smoking, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and dyslipidemia prevalence in the Greater Beirut area was higher than that reported for the general population. Important sex and age differences were also observed, whereby older participants and women had higher rates of obesity, diabetes mellitus type 2, and dyslipidemia and younger participants and men were engaged more in cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption. Interestingly, water pipe smoking was similarly prevalent among genders. The overall prevalence of CVD risk factors in this urban population is higher than reported in the 2010 World Health Organization Stepwise Approach to Surveillance report on the Lebanese population, indicating that the urban population in the capital carries a higher burden of CVD risk. In addition, sex and age difference rates of CVD risk factors highlight the need for tailored public health measures to tackle the sex- and age-based CVD risk factors.}

  abstract = {The evidence supporting the deleterious cardiovascular health effects of living near a major roadway is growing, although this association is not universal. In primary analyses, we hypothesized that residential proximity to a major roadway would be associated with incident ischemic stroke and that cardiovascular risk factors would modify that association. NOMAS (The Northern Manhattan Study) is an ongoing, population-based cohort study designed to measure cardiovascular risk factors, stroke incidence, and other outcomes in a multiethnic urban population. Recruitment occurred from 1993 to 2001 and participants are followed-up annually by telephone. Residential addresses at baseline were geocoded and Euclidean distance to nearest major roadway was estimated and categorized as in prior studies. We used Cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association of this distance to incidence of stroke and other outcomes, adjusting for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors, year at baseline, and neighborhood socioeconomic status. We assessed whether these associations varied by age, sex, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. During a median follow-up period of 15 years (n=3287), 11% of participants were diagnosed with ischemic stroke. Participants living <100 m from a roadway had a 42% (95% confidence interval, 1.01-2.02) higher rate of ischemic stroke versus those living >400 m away. This association was more pronounced among noncurrent smokers (hazard ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.26) and not evident among smokers (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-2.06). There was no clear pattern of association between proximity to major roadways and other cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, all-cause death, or vascular death. In this urban multiethnic cohort, we found evidence supporting that within-city variation in residential proximity to major roadway is associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke. An individual's smoking history modified this association, with the association remaining only among participants not currently smokers.}

  abstract = {Elevated cardiac troponin is a marker of cardiac disease and has been recently shown to be associated with embolic stroke risk. We hypothesize that early elevated troponin levels in the acute stroke setting are more prevalent in patients with embolic stroke subtypes (cardioembolic and embolic stroke of unknown source) as opposed to noncardioembolic subtypes (large-vessel disease, small-vessel disease, and other). We abstracted data from our prospective ischemic stroke database and included all patients with ischemic stroke during an 18-month period. Per our laboratory, we defined positive troponin as ≥0.1 ng/mL and intermediate as ≥0.06 ng/mL and <0.1 ng/mL. Unadjusted and adjusted regression models were built to determine the association between stroke subtype (embolic stroke of unknown source and cardioembolic subtypes) and positive and intermediate troponin levels, adjusting for key confounders, including demographics (age and sex), clinical characteristics (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, renal function, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, current smoking, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score), cardiac variables (left atrial diameter, wall-motion abnormalities, ejection fraction, and PR interval on ECG), and insular involvement of infarct. We identified 1234 patients, of whom 1129 had admission troponin levels available; 10.0% (113/1129) of these had a positive troponin. In fully adjusted models, there was an association between troponin positivity and embolic stroke of unknown source subtype (adjusted odds ratio, 4.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-7.97; P=0.003) and cardioembolic stroke subtype (odds ratio, 5.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.83-13.63; P=0.002). We found that early positive troponin after ischemic stroke may be independently associated with a cardiac embolic source. Future studies are needed to confirm our findings using high-sensitivity troponin assays and to test optimal secondary prevention strategies in patients with embolic stroke of unknown source and positive troponin.}

Baseline characteristics were collected and indices of central BP including central systolic/diastolic BP (SBP/DBP), augmentation index adjusted for 75 beats per minute of heart rate (AIx@75) were measured. Participants were separated into with and without CVD groups and between-group differences were assessed. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate potential risk factors for increased AIx@75. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate association between central SBP and AIx@75 with CVD.Mean age was 50.6 years and male participants accounted for 57.8%. Thirty-five and 43 participants had coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke. Compared with participants without CVD, those with CVD were more likely to be male and smokers and had higher glycated hemoglobin level. Additionally, participants with CVD had significantly higher central SBP and AIx@75 compared with those without CVD. Ageing, male gender, and presence of coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke were associated with increased AIx@75, whereas renin-angiotensin-axis inhibitor was associated with reduced AIx@75. After adjusted for traditional risk factors including brachial SBP, both central SBP, and AIx@75 remained significantly associated with CVD, with odds ratio and 95% confidence interval of 1.09 (1.08-1.31) and 1.20 (1.15-1.42), respectively.Diabetic patients with hypertension, ageing, male gender, and presence of CVD are independent risk factors of central BP increase; and increased central SBP and AIx@75 are significantly associated with CVD.}

Data from the multi-institutional Research Patient Data Registry were used. Presence and characteristics (high-risk plaque, including spotty calcification and low attenuation) of carotid plaque by computerized tomography among PLWHIV without known vascular disease were described. Data were compared with uninfected controls similar in age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and cigarette smoking to cases. Primary outcome was an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event, and secondary outcome was ischemic stroke. Cohort consisted of 209 PLWHIV (45±10 years, 72% male) and 168 controls. Using computerized tomography, PLWHIV without vascular disease had higher rates of any carotid plaque (34% versus 25%; P=0.04), noncalcified (18% versus 5%; P<0.001) and high-risk plaque (25% versus 16%; P=0.03). Over a follow-up of 3 years, 19 atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events (9 strokes) occurred. Carotid plaque was independently associated with a 3-fold increase in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events among PLWHIV (hazard ratio, 2.91; confidence interval, 1.10-7.7, P=0.03) and a 4-fold increased risk of stroke (hazard ratio, 4.43; confidence interval, 1.17-16.70; P=0.02); high-risk plaque was associated with a 3-fold increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events and a 4-fold increased risk of stroke. There is an increase in incidental carotid plaque, noncalcified plaque, and high-risk plaque among PLWHIV, and the presence and characteristics of carotid plaque are associated with subsequent vascular events.}

  abstract = {With potent antiretroviral drugs, HIV infection is becoming a chronic disease. Emergence of comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become a leading concern for patients living with the infection. We hypothesized that the chronic and persistent inflammation and immune activation associated with HIV disease leads to accelerated aging, characterized by CVD. This will translate into higher incidence rates of CVD in HIV infected participants, when compared to HIV negative participants, after adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors. When characterized further using cardiovascular imaging, biomarkers, immunological and genetic profiles, CVD associated with HIV will show different characteristics compared to CVD in HIV-negative individuals. The Canadian HIV and Aging cohort is a prospective, controlled cohort study funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. It will recruit patients living with HIV who are aged 40 years or older or have lived with HIV for 15 years or more. A control population, frequency matched for age, sex, and smoking status, will be recruited from the general population. Patients will attend study visits at baseline, year 1, 2, 5 and 8. At each study visit, data on complete medical and pharmaceutical history will be captured, along with anthropometric measures, a complete physical examination, routine blood tests and electrocardiogram. Consenting participants will also contribute blood samples to a research biobank. The primary outcome is incidence of a composite of: myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, stroke, hospitalization for angina or congestive heart failure, revascularization or amputation for peripheral artery disease, or cardiovascular death. Preplanned secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality, incidence of the metabolic syndrome, incidence of type 2 diabetes, incidence of renal failure, incidence of abnormal bone mineral density and body fat distribution. Patients participating to the cohort will be eligible to be enrolled in four pre-planned sub-studies of cardiovascular imaging, glucose metabolism, immunological and genetic risk profile. The Canadian HIV and Aging Cohort will provide insights on pathophysiological pathways leading to premature CVD for patients living with HIV.}

In a large magnetic resonance imaging-verified cohort of lacunar infarct patients, we investigated the risk factor profile of lacunar infarction and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics. One thousand twenty-three patients with lacunar infarction (mean age, 56.7; SD, 8.5) were recruited from 72 stroke centers throughout the United Kingdom as part of the UK Young Lacunar Stroke DNA Study. Risk factor profiles were compared with 1961 stroke-free population controls with similar age. Furthermore, we tested risk factor profiles of lacunar stroke patients for association with the presence of multiple lacunar infarcts, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and location of the acute lacunar infarct. Hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 2.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-2.64), diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.61-2.73), hyperlipidemia (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.46-2.07), and smoking (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.39-1.96) were independently associated in lacunar infarct patients compared with healthy controls. Patients with multiple lacunar infarcts were more likely to be men (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.81-3.53) and have hypertension (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.12-2.04) compared with patients with a single lacunar infarct, independent of other vascular risk factors. The presence of moderate-to-severe WMH versus no or mild WMH was independently associated with increased age (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.12-2.04), hypertension (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.44-2.95), and impaired renal function (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.98). In this magnetic resonance imaging-verified lacunar stroke population, we identified a distinct risk factor profile in the group as a whole. However, there were differing risk factor profiles according to the presence of multiple lacunar infarcts and confluent WMH. The association of hypertension, smoking, and renal impairment with the presence of multiple lacunar infarcts and confluent WMH might reflect a diffuse small vessel arteriopathy.}

The two groups of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke were compared with respect to age, sex, the prevalence, and distribution of the risk factors. Results Among 230 patients (84.3% ischemic stroke) with mean age of 61.2 years, hypertension (73%), diabetes mellitus (53%), cardiovascular disease (51%), and dyslipidemia (47%) were the most frequent risk factors. Hypertension was significantly more prevalent in males compared with females (88% vs. 60%, OR = 4.91, 95% CI: 2.48-9.71). Hypertension, smoking, and opioid consumption were associated with hemorrhagic stroke. Dyslipidemia was significantly higher in ischemic stroke (OR = 2.65, 95% CI: 1.21-5.8). Overall, 84.3% of stroke occurred in patients aged >50 years (92.8% of women vs. 74.5% of the men, OR = 4.43, 95% CI: 1.93-10.16, p = 0.001). Conclusion Stroke was more prevalent in females; hypertension was more prevalent in males. In the age group less than 50 years old, stroke is more prevalent in men.}

We investigated the effectiveness of a management program for attaining cardiometabolic targets in survivors of stroke/transient ischemic attack. Randomized controlled trial of survivors of stroke/transient ischemic attack aged ≥18 years. General practices were randomized to usual care (control) or an intervention comprising specialist review of care plans and nurse education in addition to usual care. The outcome is attainment of pre-defined cardiometabolic targets based on Australian guidelines. Multivariable regression was undertaken to determine efficacy and identify factors associated with attaining targets. Overall, 283 subjects were randomized to the intervention and 280 to controls. Although we found no between-group difference in overall cardiometabolic targets achieved at 12 months, the intervention group more often achieved control of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (odds ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-3.29) than controls. At 24 months, no between-group differences were observed. Medication adherence was ≥80% at follow-up, but uptake of lifestyle/behavioral habits was poor. Older age, being male, being married/living with partner, and having greater functional ability or a history of diabetes mellitus were associated with attaining targets. The intervention in this largely negative trial only had a detectable effect on attaining target for lipids but not for other factors at 12 months or any factor at 24 months. This limited effect may be attributable to inadequate uptake of behavioral/lifestyle interventions, highlighting the need for new or better approaches to achieve meaningful behavioral change.

For example, predicted 1-year probabilities for a hypothetical 60-year-old white woman with eGFR of 30mL/min/1.73m2, urine protein excretion of 1.8g/d, and no diabetes or CVD (risk characteristics similar to the average participant) were 3.3%, 4.1%, and 0.3%, for first developing CVD, ESRD, and death, respectively. For a 40-year-old African American man with similar characteristics but higher systolic blood pressure, the corresponding 1-year probabilities were 2.4%, 13.2%, and 0.1%. For all participants, the development of ESRD or CVD increased the risk for subsequent mortality, with no differences by patient race or body mass index. The CRIC population was specifically recruited for kidney disease, and the vast majority had seen a nephrologist.

Suicidal thoughts were reported by 21.4% of patients with asthma and 9.8% of controls (p < 0.001). Suicidal attempts were reported by 1.0% of the patients with asthma and 0.4% of controls (p < 0.001). Following adjustment for age, sex, income, education, job, marital status, smoking, alcohol, exercise, and presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stroke, arthritis, and depression, the ORs for suicidal ideation with asthma were 1.53 (95% CI 1.42-1.65) and that for suicidal attempts was 1.32 (95% CI 1.01-1.73). We found that asthma increased the risk for suicidal ideation and attempts, even controlling for the effects of socioeconomic status, physical health status, comorbid chronic medical diseases, and depressive mood. Our finding suggests that asthma per se may be an independent risk factor for suicidality.}

The aim of this study was to account for risk factor prevalence in TIA patients and analyze the association between TIA characteristics and risk factors. We included 20,871 TIA events in 19,872 patients who were registered in the Swedish Riksstroke registry during the years 2010 through 2012. Data from other Swedish registers were used for comparison. The following variables were analyzed: age, sex, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation (AF), cigarette smoking, and antihypertensive treatment. Compared to the general population (based on data retrieved from Sweden's national public health survey 'Health on equal terms'), TIA patients more often had diabetes mellitus (prevalence ratio, PR = 2.3), AF without oral anticoagulants (OAC) (PR = 2.8), and AF on OAC (PR = 1.6). Blood pressure medication was less prevalent among TIA patients than in the general population (PR = 0.57). Increasing age was associated with longer attacks. The fact that diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and smoking are more common in TIA patients than in the general population suggests that these factors are risk factors for TIA, even if causal relations cannot be proven. The relation between increasing age and longer attacks possibly reflects an increased proportion of embolic TIAs, or impaired recovery ability. Our results also suggest a significant proportion of untreated hypertension cases in the population.}

Statistically significant differences were found between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients regarding the RMI, MBI, BRS, and the FACS (p<0.001). Age had a poor negative correlation with the FACS and RMI. It is suggested that age is an important risk factor for the development of stroke, but it has no strong effect on functional status and disability in patients with stroke. The BRS, FACS, MBI, MRS, and RMI scales can be used in stroke patients whether they are under or over 65 years old in order to evaluate functional status and disability.}

  abstract = {Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most common premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)-related monogenic disorder, and it is associated with ischemic heart disease. There is limited information whether FH increases the risk of peripheral arterial and cerebrovascular disease. Our aim was to analyze ASCVD prevalence and characteristics in different arterial territories in a large FH population, to compare them with an unaffected control population and to determine which factors are associated to ASCVD. SAFEHEART (Spanish Familial Hypercholesterolaemia Cohort Study) is an ongoing registry of molecularly defined patients with heterozygous FH in Spain. ASCVD in the different arterial territories was analyzed, as well as individual characteristics, genetic variables, and lipid-lowering therapies. The study recruited 4132 subjects (3745 ≥18 years); 2,752 of those enrolled were molecularly diagnosed FH cases. Median age was 44.0 years (45.9% men) and 40 years (46.6% men) in FH patients and unaffected relatives (P<0.001). ASCVD was present in 358 (13.0%) and 47 (4.7%) FH patients and unaffected relatives, respectively (P<0.001). History of premature ASCVD was more prevalent in FH patients (9.4% and 2.4% in FH patients and unaffected relatives, respectively; P<0.001). Coronary artery-related manifestations and peripheral artery disease were more prevalent in FH patients than in controls, but no significant differences were found for cerebrovascular events. Age, body mass index, type 2 diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, previous use of tobacco, and lipoprotein(a) >50 mg/dL were independently associated with ASCVD. The prevalence of ASCVD is higher, and the involvement of the arterial territories is different in FH patients when compared with their unaffected relatives. Age, male sex, increased body mass index, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, smoking habit, and lipoprotein(a) >50 mg/dL were independently associated to ASCVD.

We examined possible sex-related differences in supine and upright cardiovascular regulation. Hemodynamics were recorded from 167 men and 167 women of matching age (≈45 years) and body mass index (≈26.5) during passive head-up tilt. None had diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular disease other than hypertension or used antihypertensive medication. Whole-body impedance cardiography, tonometric radial blood pressure, and heart rate variability were analyzed. Results were adjusted for height, smoking, alcohol intake, mean arterial pressure, plasma lipids, and glucose. Supine hemodynamic differences were minor: Men had lower heart rate (-4%) and higher stroke index (+7.5%) than women (P<0.05 for both). Upright systemic vascular resistance was lower (-10%), but stroke index (+15%), cardiac index (+16%), and left cardiac work were clearly higher (+20%) in men than in women (P<0.001 for all). Corresponding results were observed in a subgroup of men and postmenopausal women (n=76, aged >55 years). Heart rate variability analyses showed higher low:high frequency ratios in supine (P<0.001) and upright (P=0.003) positions in men. The foremost difference in cardiovascular regulation between sexes was higher upright hemodynamic workload for the heart in men, a finding not explained by known cardiovascular risk factors or hormonal differences before menopause. Heart rate variability analyses indicated higher sympathovagal balance in men regardless of body position. The deviations in upright hemodynamics could play a role in the differences in cardiovascular risk between men and women. URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT01742702.}

A cross-sectional study of 2258 patients with primary hypertension were enrolled in this study, including 871 stroke cases (62.89%) in 1385 hypertensive patients without hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) and 647 (74.11%) stroke cases in 873 hypertensive patients with HHcy. Basic information of patients were collected, including age, sex, height, weight, smoking, alcohol consumption, and disease history. Blood chemical assays were performed to determine the levels of glucose, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol, and homocysteine. Subsequently, comparison of stroke morbidity between the 2 groups was performed after the stratification of risk factors. Moreover, the correlation between the stroke morbidity and the risk factors was analyzed using a trend test in patients with H-type hypertension. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between baseline factors and prevalence of stroke in H-type hypertensive patients. After the stratification of risk factors, a statistical difference was noted in age (range, 45-74 yrs), glucose ranges (<6.1 and ≥7.0 mmol/L), BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), non-HDL-C, and triglyceride level of <200 mg/dL (P<0.05) in the H-type hypertension group compared with those in non-H-type hypertension group. Gradual elevation of stroke morbidity was identified with the increase of fasting glucose, SBP, and DBP. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, only higher SBP, DBP, fasting glucose level, homocysteine, and history of diabetes mellitus were the independent predictors for the stroke morbidity. Comprehensive evaluation and strict management of multiple risk factors have become increasingly important in the alleviation of stroke morbidity for H-type hypertensive patients because these patients were more sensitive to the classic risk factors.}

We studied 502,650 people (54.41% women), 6669 (1.23%) participants self-reported a stroke. The nurse-led interview identified 7669 (1.53%) people with stroke and 1781 (0.35%) with TIA. Hypertension, smoking, higher WHR, lower alcohol consumption and diabetes were all more common in people with cerebrovascular disease (p<0.0001 for each). Women with cerebrovascular disease were less likely to have taken the OCP (p=0.0002). People with cerebrovascular disease did more exercise (p=0.03). Antithrombotic medication was taken by 81% of people with stroke (both self-report and nurse-led responders) and 89% with TIA. For self-reported stroke, 63% were taking antithrombotic and cholesterol medications, 54% taking antithrombotic and antihypertensive medications and 46% taking all 3. For the nurse-led interview and TIA, these figures were 65%, 54% and 46%, and 70%, 53% and 45%, respectively. The UK Biobank provides a large, generalisable and contemporary data source in a young population. The characterisation of the UK Biobank cohort with cerebrovascular disease will form the basis for ongoing research using this data source.}

Diabetic neuropathy was diagnosed if the patients showed two or more of the following three characteristics: neuropathic symptoms, the absence of the Achilles reflex, or abnormal vibration perception. Diabetic nephropathy was defined as positive when the estimated glomerular filtration rate was <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and/or the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was ≥34 mg/mmol creatinine. Several ophthalmology specialists were responsible for evaluating diabetic retinopathy. Adjustment was made for sex, age, body mass index, duration of diabetes mellitus, current smoking, current drinking, hypertension, stroke, ischemic heart disease, and glycated hemoglobin. The prevalence of nocturia was 80.4%. Diabetic retinopathy was independently positively associated with nocturia (adjusted odds ratio 2.39 [95% confidence interval: 1.08-6.11]). In contrast, diabetic nephropathy or diabetic neuropathy was not associated with nocturia.

Lacunar infarcts are considered to be related to cognitive impairment. We therefore conducted a study to assess the association between cognitive impairment and PI in patients with a lacunar infarct. Consecutive patients presenting with an acute lacunar syndrome who were admitted to the stroke unit were enrolled. The patients were examined with Doppler ultrasonography of the intracranial arteries, and the PI of the middle cerebral artery was recorded. Cognitive function was evaluated by mini-mental state examination (MMSE), clock drawing test, and trail making test (TMT) A and B. Among the 113 patients included, 85 patients had an acute lacunar infarct and 28 had one or more nonlacunar infarcts. The mean PI was 1.46 (SD = .33). PI was significantly (P < .05) associated with MMSE, TMT A and TMT B in patients with lacunar infarct, even after adjustment for multiple patient characteristics (age, sex, prestroke hypertension, smoking, previous stroke, and diabetes). PI was associated with the cognitive performance in patients with lacunar infarcts and a lacunar syndrome. An elevated PI may be related to impairment in several cognitive domains. These findings suggest that transcranial Doppler ultrasonography could be an adjunct tool for early diagnosis of cognitive impairment after stroke.}

A community-based study recruited from over 40 residential facilities across the metropolitan Chicago area. Community-dwelling very old adults (n = 1520; mean age 80.2; standard deviation 7.7). Eleven motor performances were summarized using a composite motor score. All prescription and over the counter medications taken by participants were inspected and coded using the Medi-Span Data Base System. Demographic characteristics and medical history were obtained by means of detailed interview and medical examinations. In multiple linear regression models, antihypertensive medications were associated with global motor score [β = -0.075, standard error (SE) 0.011, P < .001]. Thus, motor function in an individual with antihypertensive medication, was on average, about 7.5% lower than an age-, sex-, and education-matched individual without antihypertensive medication. The number of antihypertensive medications, which were being used had an additive effect, such that a reduction in the level of motor function was observed with each additional medication, and receiving 3 or more antihypertensive medications was associated with about a 15% reduction in the level of motor function. The association between antihypertensive medications and motor function was robust, and remained unchanged after adjusting for confounding by indication using several potentially confounding variables: smoking, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and intermittent claudication (β = -0.05, SE 0.015, P = .001). In contrast, the use of statin medications was not related to motor function (unadjusted: β = 0.003, SE 0.015, P = .826; fully adjusted: β = 0.018, SE 0.014, P = .216). The use of antihypertensive medications is associated with a lower level of motor function in very old adults. The nature of this association warrants further investigation.}

Of the pharmacotherapies, statins offer the most significant benefits but may not be well tolerated in some women. Aspirin may also benefit high-risk women. Other pharmacotherapies, such as fibrates, ezetimibe, niacin, fish oil, and hormone replacement therapy, remain unproven and, in some cases, potentially dangerous to women with DM. To reduce CV events, risks to women with DM must be better publicized and additional research must be done.

Twenty-nine patients (52%) had chronic kidney disease. Of these, 18 patients (62%) had end-stage kidney disease and 7 patients (24%) underwent renal transplantation. Fourteen patients (25%) and 3 patients (5%) had moderate or severe mitral regurgitation and mitral stenosis, respectively. Aortic valve disease was present in 37 patients (66%). Moderate or severe left ventricular dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy were identified in 9 patients (16%) and 31 patients (56%), respectively.

Although C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha are known to predict carotid atherosclerosis, they are difficult to obtain in clinical practice. By studying the association between neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and carotid artery intima-media thickening (IMT) in patients with ischemic stroke, we determined that the NLR can predict carotid stenosis. We selected 252 patients with acute to subacute ischemic stroke who underwent carotid ultrasonography and complete and differential blood cell count tests. We collected data on sex, age, body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and heart disease. Male and female patients were analyzed separately. We divided the subjects into 2 groups according to carotid IMT, and compared baseline characteristics and NLR between the 2 groups. The regression analysis was adjusted for confounding factors such as age, BMI, NLR, smoking, alcohol consumption, and a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, or heart disease. Carotid IMT tended to significantly increase with NLR and age in men and with age in women. In men, multiple linear regression analyses adjusted for confounding factors showed that NLR (P < 0.001) and age (P = 0.001) had a significant positive association with carotid IMT (adjusted R(2) = 0.185, root mean squared error [MSE] = 0.152). However, no parameters showed significant positive associations in women. NLR can be a clinically significant predictor of the degree of carotid stenosis in male patients with ischemic stroke. However, additional studies are required to obtain more concrete results.}

From January 2009 to December 2011, 810 patients with acute ischemic stroke aged 75 years or older were recruited in China. Clinical profile and risk factors were recorded. Outcomes and associated risk factors at 12 and 36 months after stroke were assessed by sex. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemias, and obesity prevalence rates were higher in women than in men; opposite trends were found for smoking and alcohol consumption. The mortality rate at 12 months after stroke was significantly greater in men than in women (23.3% versus 16.6%, P = .015). Large-artery atherothrombotic and cardioembolic stroke subtypes were risk factors for mortality, recurrence, and dependency in both sexes. In men, atrial fibrillation was a risk factor of mortality at 12 months after stroke (relative ratio [RR], 2.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-3.27), but obesity was a protective factor of mortality at 36 months after stroke (RR, .30; 95% CI, .10-.94).

We assessed sex differences in stroke outcomes and associated risk factors at 12 and 36 months after stroke in a large hospital-based stroke registry of elderly patients from Northern China. Thus, it is crucial to emphasize risk management to elderly patients to reduce mortality, recurrence, and dependency after stroke.}

  abstract = {Hypercholesterolemia is common in older adults and less treated, but little is known about correlates of untreated hypercholesterolemia. Using a standard interview method we examined a random sample of 7,572 participants aged ≥60 years in a community-based household survey across 7 provinces of China during 2007-2012, and documented 328 cases of hypercholesterolemia from self-reported doctor diagnosis. Compared to participants with normal cholesterol, older adults with hypercholesterolemia had higher socioeconomic position and larger body mass index. In patients with hypercholesterolemia, 209 were not treated using lipid-lowering medications (63.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 58.5%-68.9%). Untreated hypercholesterolemia was significantly associated with female sex (adjusted odds ratio 2.13, 95%CI 1.17-3.89), current smoking (3.48, 1.44-8.44), heavy alcohol drinking (3.13,1.11-8.84), chronic bronchitis (2.37,1.14-4.90) and high level of meat consumptions (2.85,1.22-6.65). Although having coronary heart disease exposed participants for treatment, half of participants with coronary heart disease did not receive lipid-lowering medications. Among hypercholesterolemia participants with stroke, hypertension or diabetes, more than half of them did not receive lipid-lowering medications. The high proportion of untreated hypercholesterolemia in older, high-risk Chinese adults needs to be mitigated through multi-faceted primary and secondary prevention strategies to increase population opportunities of treating hypercholesterolemia.}

The aim of this study was to explore, for the first time, the relationship between IL-1β -31 T/C polymorphism and the risk of ischemic stroke (IS) among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). One hundred ninety-six patients with IS (117 diabetics and 79 nondiabetics) and 192 controls were recruited to enroll in this study. IL-1β genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP technique. After adjusting for sex, age, smoking, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, there was no significant difference in the distribution of IL-1β -31 T/C genotypes and allele frequencies between IS patients with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus and control group (p > 0.05). Moreover, a significant positive correlation between serum IL-1β level and glucose (p1 = 0.044) was showed. In addition, serum levels of IL-1β were found to be higher among TT genotype carriers than TC and CC genotype carriers in ischemic stroke patients with or without T2DM but these differences were not significant. These results indicate that IL-1β gene polymorphism might not be a risk factor in the development of ischemic stroke in Tunisian population.}

The IV-tPA utilization rate (5% vs 6%, P = .48) and the hospital length of stay (10 ± 17 days vs 10 ± 49 days, P = .86) were not different between the two groups. Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders with ischemic stroke have modestly different age of stroke presentation and burden of risk factors compared to each other. Disaggregating these two racial groups may be important to unmask any potential clinical differences in future studies.}

LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and both LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals in the overall cohort were achieved by 73%, 73.4%, and 68.9% patients, respectively. Significant predictors of meeting all 3 goals were age, male gender, statin, nonstatin, and combined statin plus nonstatin use. Patients with co-morbidities of hypertension, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, peripheral arterial disease, myocardial infarction, and smoking were less likely to have LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and both LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels at National Cholesterol Education Program goal. In the overall cohort, patients with DM were less likely to meet non-HDL-C and both LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals. In the subgroup of patients with DM, predictors of meeting lipid goals were similar to the overall cohort. In conclusion, these data suggest contemporary treatment patterns by cardiologists successfully achieve lipid goals in most patients. Younger, female patients and those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and risk factors, such as hypertension and DM, are less likely to achieve goals and may require more careful follow-up after statin initiation. Both LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals are achieved in <70% of patients, suggesting room for improvement if a goal-targeted individualized strategy is adopted.}

Regional hospital, Hong Kong. Data on patients undergoing upper-extremity venous sonography examinations during a 13-year period from November 1999 to October 2012 were retrieved. Variables including age, sex, history of smoking, history of lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis, major surgery within 30 days, immobilisation within 30 days, cancer (history of malignancy), associated central venous or indwelling catheter, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, sepsis within 30 days, and stroke within 30 days were tested using binary logistic regression to understand the risk factors for upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis. The presence of upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis identified. Overall, 213 patients with upper-extremity sonography were identified. Of these patients, 29 (13.6%) had upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis. The proportion of upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis using initial ultrasound was 0.26% of all deep vein thrombosis ultrasound requests. Upper limb swelling was the most common presentation seen in a total of 206 (96.7%) patients. Smoking (37.9%), history of cancer (65.5%), and hypertension (27.6%) were the more prevalent conditions among patients in the upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis-positive group. No statistically significant predictor of upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis was noted if all variables were included. After backward stepwise logistic regression, the final model was left with only age (P=0.119), female gender (P=0.114), and history of malignancy (P=0.024) as independent variables. History of malignancy remained predictive of upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis. Upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis is uncommon among symptomatic Chinese population. The most common sign is swelling and the major risk factor for upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis identified in this study is malignancy.}

Demographics, presentation, treatment, and outcomes at 6 months were analyzed. Primary outcomes included mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, rehospitalization, and stroke at 6 months. Secondary analyses assessed risk factors, management, and trends over time. Women under 55 years represented 8% of the entire cohort, and 26% of patients under age 55 years. Compared to older women, young women were more likely to be smokers (51 vs. 14%, p < 0.001) and obese (44 vs. 34%, p = 0.006). Young women had more diabetes and hypertension than young men. Mortality was lowest among young women and did not change over time. Young women received less treatment with aspirin, beta blockers, lipid-lowering agents, and ACE inhibitors, and underwent less coronary angiography and stenting than young men (44 vs. 59%, p < 0.001). Rehospitalization was higher among young women than young men (37 vs. 27%, p < 0.001), with no change over time. Modifiable risk factors such as smoking, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension should be addressed in young women. Following ACS, young women received fewer evidence-based medications, were treated less invasively, and had higher readmission rates within 6 months compared to young men.}

Several case studies have reported compression of the vertebral artery induced by cervical osteophytes that has resulted in posterior circulation infarcts (POCI). However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have yet analyzed differences in the risk factors and stroke subtypes between ischemic stroke patients with cervical spondylosis and those without. In the case-controlled study reported here, we analyzed the risk factors and stroke subtypes in ischemic stroke patients with and without cervical spondylosis. Characteristics in all the recruited patients with POCI and non-POCI were further compared to extract other risk factors that could predict the occurrence of POCI. We filtered out ischemic stroke patients with cervical spondylosis ("Stroke+C" group) by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. We analyzed the data of 38 subjects in the Stroke+C group and 152 sex- and age-comparable ischemic stroke patients without cervical spondylosis ("Stroke-C" group). We recorded the demographic characteristics including sex and age, and stroke risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart disease, hyperlipidemia, and smoking habits. The stroke classifications were defined by the Oxford Community Stroke Project classification. All subjects were further categorized into POCI or non-POCI groups. The ultrasound findings of the vertebral arteries (extracranial and intracranial) in the Stroke+C group were also recorded. More patients in the Stroke+C group tended to have POCI (34.2%) than patients in the Stroke-C group (17.5%) (odds ratio [OR] =2.41, P<0.05). Furthermore, hypertension (OR=3.41, P<0.01) and cervical spondylosis (OR=2.41, P<0.05) were two independent risk factors for POCI in ischemic stroke patients. Ischemic stroke patients with cervical spondylosis are more prone to POCI than those without cervical spondylosis. Hypertension is another identified risk factor for POCI in ischemic stroke patients. The occurrence of POCI should be highlighted for patients with cervical spondylosis.}

All demographic and clinical data were collected by the physicians and master degree candidates in the division of cardiology. The Logistic regression models of multiple risk factors were established for ACS by different genders. More than 45 years of age, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity and hypertension were all independent risk factors of ACS for different genders (P < 0.05). However, the same risk factors had different pathogenic effects on ACS between genders. The odds ratio (OR) was markedly different for females and males: per 5-year increase aged over 45 years (1.45 vs 1.13), dyslipidemia (3.45 vs 1.68), type 2 diabetes mellitus (4.06 vs 2.33), obesity (2.93 vs 1.91) and hypertension (1.78 vs 3.80) respectively (all P < 0.05). In addition, current smoking increased the risk of ACS attack in males by 5.49 (P < 0.05) while not statistically significant in females. Particularly cerebral ischemic stroke increased the risk of ACS attack by 5.49 folds in males other than females (P < 0.05). Type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and obesity may present higher risks of ACS attack for females than males. And smoking and hypertension are much more dangerous for males. Males with cerebral infarction are more susceptible for ACS than females.}

The occurrence of PAD was examined retrospectively in 171 consecutive patients with LSS and severe IC who underwent surgical treatment at our hospital from June 2012 to June 2013. Data were collected on background characteristics (sex, age) and known risk factors for PAD, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, hyperlipidemia, stroke, and ischemic heart disease. Of the 171 patients enrolled, 7 had an abnormal ankle-brachial index (ABI). Computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed in these patients, and a final diagnosis of PAD was established for all 7 patients. The incidence of PAD in all patients with LSS was 4.1%(7 of 171). Stroke and ischemic heart disease were significantly more common in the LSSPAD group compared with the LSS group. Multiple logistic regression analyses with a forced-entry method revealed that age and stroke (p<0.05) were independent risk factors for PAD. To prevent misdiagnosis of fatal PAD, we recommend ABI be assessed in patients with LSS and history of stroke.}

The relationship between low ABI and intra/extracranial atherosclerosis was analyzed in the present study. Patients with large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) and small artery disease (SAD) were enrolled in this study according to the classic Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) subtypes. Subjects were divided into three groups: intracranial atherosclerosis (IAS), extracranial atherosclerosis (EAS) and the small artery disease group. All of the enrolled patients underwent ABI measurement and were assessed for risk factors. The association between low ABI (<0.9) and extra/intra cranial atherosclerosis were examined using logistic regression. Altogether, 31.51% of LAA patients were diagnosed with peripheral artery disease, which was much higher than that of the SAD patients (19.75%, P=0.045). There was a remarkable difference in the prevalence of abnormal ABI in the EAS stenosis and IAS stenosis patients (47.17% vs. 22.31%, P=0.001). Multivariable logistic regression identified peripheral artery disease (OR=2.759, 95% CI: 1.485-5.124) and smoking (OR=2.032, 95%CI:1.093-3.779) as independent risk factors for EAS stenosis. However hypertension (OR=1.957, 95%CI: 1.119-3.421) as well as male sex (OR=2.024, 95%CI: 1.251-3.274) were found to be independent risk factors for IAS stenosis. Peripheral artery disease was not associated with IAS stenosis (OR=1.075, 95%CI: 0.516-2.238). Intracranial atherosclerosis was not associated with a low ABI (<0.9) in the stroke patients. Low ABI is significantly associated with age (>65 years), extra-cranial atherosclerotic and diabetes mellitus. Among ischemic stroke patients, a low ABI can be useful in predicting EAS.}

From April 2008 to September 2009, controls were enrolled via internet after providing consent for participation through a web-based survey. The cases included patients who were admitted to the participating centers due to acute stroke or transient ischemic attack within 7 days of onset during the study period. Each control was age- and sex-matched with 2 cases. Adjusted odd ratios, age-standardized prevalence, and PARs were estimated for the 9 major risk factors using the prevalence of risk factors in the control group and the age and sex characteristics from Korea's national census data. In total, 1041 controls were matched to 2082 stroke cases. Because of a shortage of elderly controls in the internet-based recruitment, 248 controls were recruited off-line. The PARs were 23.44%, 10.95%, 51.32%, and 6.35% for hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and stroke history, respectively. Hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation, obesity, coronary heart disease, and a family history of stroke were not associated with stroke. Comparison with education and religion of the control group with that mentioned in the national census data showed a notable difference. The study results imply that internet-based control recruitment for a case-control study requires careful selection of risk factors with high self-awareness and effective strategies to facilitate the recruitment of elderly participants.}

Diabetes and prediabetes awareness were self-reported; those unaware of diabetes and prediabetes were defined by fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥126 mg/dL or HbA1c ≥6.5% and FPG 100-125 mg/dL or HbA1c of 5.7%-6.4%, respectively. Components of nutrient intake on a given day assessed were total calories, sugar, carbohydrates, fiber, protein, fat, and total cholesterol, stratified by sex and glycemic status awareness. Estimates of nutrient intake were adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, education level, BMI, smoking status, and family history of diabetes. Men with diagnosed diabetes consumed less sugar (mean 86.8 vs. 116.8 g) and carbohydrates (mean 235.0 vs. 262.1 g) and more protein (mean 92.3 vs. 89.7 g) than men with undiagnosed diabetes. Similarly, women with diagnosed diabetes consumed less sugar (mean 79.1 vs. 95.7 g) and more protein (mean 67.4 vs. 56.6 g) than women with undiagnosed diabetes.

All participants, regardless of sex or glycemic status, consumed on average less than the American Diabetes Association recommendations for fiber intake (i.e., 14 g/1,000 kcal) and slightly more saturated fat than recommended (>10% of total kcal). Screening and subsequent knowledge of glycemic status may favorably affect some dietary patterns for people with diabetes.}

To date, no prospective epidemiological studies have investigated this association. A population-based sample of blacks (n=3497; mean age=54 years; female=62%) was followed from 1987 to 2011 in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, contributing a total of 65 371 person-years. Hazard ratios and incidence rate differences for ischemic stroke were estimated, contrasting SCT to homozygous hemoglobin A. Models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, total cholesterol, atrial fibrillation, and coronary heart disease. SCT was identified in 223 (6.4%) participants. During a median follow-up of 22 years, 401 subjects experienced incident stroke (89% ischemic). Incident ischemic stroke was more frequent among those with SCT (13%) than those with homozygous hemoglobin A (10%). SCT was associated with an ischemic stroke hazard ratio of 1.4 (1.0-2.0) and an incidence rate difference amounting to 1.9 (0.4-3.8) extra strokes per 1000 person-years. We observed an increased risk of ischemic stroke in blacks with SCT. Further investigation of the incidence and pathophysiology of stroke in patients with SCT is warranted.}

A descriptive cross-sectional study in primary prevention in 1257 women (ages 19-84 years) from Argentina. TPA was measured by ultrasonography. Framingham sex-specific risk equations were used to predict the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke during the next 10 years. Patients were divided into diabetic (n = 293) and control groups (n = 964), and then each group was divided according to age (>40, 40-49, 50-59, and ≥60 years). No difference was observed between diabetic and control groups in the incidence of smoking or the presence of early family cardiovascular event. Overall, diabetic patients had higher body mass index, blood pressure, and TPA versus the control group. The Framingham risk score was higher in the diabetic group in all age groups. The mean (SD) coronary heart disease scores for the diabetic group at <40, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, and ≥60 were 6% (1.7%), 19% (2.5%), 38% (2.0%), and 60% (1.5%), respectively, whereas the scores in the control group 3% (0.8%), 7% (0.9%), 17% (0.9%), and 40% (0.9%), respectively. The stroke score was also enhanced in diabetic women, independent of their age. These data indicate that diabetic women in the premenopausal age or the early years of menopause age (40-50 years) are at intermediate or higher risk of developing a cardiovascular event. Premenopausal diabetic women should be considered at possibly high risk of cardiovascular events compared with nondiabetic women. Direct assessment of atherosclerotic burden, such as TPA, should be used early in this population instead of relying on traditional risk scores.}

A total of 4480 participants with HTN but without prevalent CV disease at baseline (years 1987-1989) from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study were included. Measurements of SBP were taken at baseline and at 3 triennial visits; SBP was treated as a time-dependent variable and categorized as elevated (≥140 mm Hg), standard (120-139 mm Hg), and low (<120 mm Hg). Multivariable Cox regression models included baseline age, sex, diabetes status, BMI, high cholesterol level, smoking status, and alcohol intake. Incident composite CV events (heart failure, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or death related to coronary heart disease). After a median follow-up of 21.8 years, a total of 1622 incident CV events had occurred. Participants with elevated SBP developed incident CV events at a significantly higher rate than those in the low BP group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.26-1.69). However, there was no difference in incident CV event-free survival among those in the standard vs low SBP group (adjusted HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.85-1.17). Further adjustment for BP medication use or diastolic BP did not significantly affect the results. Among patients with HTN, having an elevated SBP carries the highest risk for cardiovascular events, but in this categorical analysis, once SBP was below 140 mm Hg, an SBP lower than 120 mm Hg did not appear to lessen the risk of incident CV events.}

We measured an arterial stiffness in 110 normal subjects who were 20 to 69 yr-old with no evidence of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular accident or diabetes mellitus. The mean values of baPWV and cfPWV were 12.6 (± 2.27) m/sec (13.1 ± 1.85 in men, 12.1 ± 2.51 in women; P=0.019) and 8.70 (± 1.99) m/sec (9.34 ± 2.13 in men, 8.15 ± 1.69 in women; P=0.001), respectively. The distribution of baPWV (P<0.001) and cfPWV (P=0.006) by age group and gender showed an increase in the mean value with age. Men had higher baPWV and cfPWV than women (P<0.001). There was a difference in baPWV and cfPWV by age group on prehypertension, dyslipidemia, current smoking, or obesity (P<0.001). In multiple linear regression, age and prehypertension were highly associated with baPWV and cfPWV after adjustment for confounding factors (P<0.001). The present study showed that baPWV and cfPWV are associated with age, gender, and prehypertension in healthy Koreans.}

We developed a common regression model to ABI and TBI by extending the linear mixed model, and statistically detected the difference in the impact of risk factors between the two indices. Sex, smoking, proteinuria, hypertension, and history of stroke and coronary artery disease were common independent risk factors for the decrease of ABI and TBI; their impacts on ABI and TBI were not significantly different. On the other hand, the impact of age, diabetic duration, and body mass index was significantly different between the two indices (all p < 0.05). Age and body mass index were significantly associated with TBI but not with ABI. Diabetic duration had a significant impact both on TBI and ABI, but the impact on TBI was significantly greater than that on ABI (β = -0.144 vs. -0.087; p < 0.05). In the population with normal ABI, patients with these risk factors had a higher prevalence of decreased TBI. The risk factors for the decrease of ABI and TBI were not identical in Japanese diabetic patients. Age, diabetic duration and body mass index were associated with reduced TBI in patients with normal ABI.}

It is unclear what the status of diagnostic workup related to etiology is in Chinese hospitals which treat the majority of the hemorrhagic patients in the world. We aim to demonstrate characteristics on diagnostic workup implemented routinely in both departments of Neurology and Neurosurgery in patients with SICH. We enrolled patients with SICH from March 2002 to December 2011 from Chengdu stroke registry. Data on diagnostic workup were extracted. A total of 2264 patients diagnosed as SICH with rapid neuroimaging (computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) scan were included. Patients in the department of Neurosurgery had a lower median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and a longer median length of stay. They had a significantly lower proportion of hyperlipidemia and heart disease, but a higher proportion of hypertension, alcohol consumption and history of stroke (all p < 0.05). Following diagnostic workups were more frequently undertaken in the Neurological Department than in the neurosurgical Department: digital subtraction angiography (DSA), plain CT, plain MRI, carotid duplex ultrasound (all p < 0.001). However, computed tomography angiography (CTA), contrast-enhanced MRI, and brain biopsy (all p < 0.001) were implemented more in the Neurosurgical Department. While no difference in the proportion of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was found between the two departments, the intracranial vascular imaging (workup contains at least one of CTA, MRA and DSA) was performed more frequently in the Department of Neurosurgery (29.8% vs. 9.1%, p < 0.001). The independent predictors contribute to the implementation of vascular examinations were gender, age, GCS score on admission, department of patients admitted in and the year patients were hospitalized in (all p < 0.05). Younger patients, females, with severe stroke onset (evaluated by GCS score), admitted in Department of Neurosurgery and hospitalized in recent years had undertaken more examinations on intracranial vascular. It is an urgency to explore a practical scheme of diagnostic workup for the etiology of SICH.}

The aim of this study is to quantify socio-demographic and health risk factors and mental and physical health status among Aboriginal participants from the 45 and Up Study and to compare these with non-Aboriginal participants from the study. The 45 and Up Study is a large-scale study of individuals aged 45 years and older from the general population of New South Wales, Australia responding to a baseline questionnaire distributed from 2006-2008. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of self-reported responses from the baseline questionnaire for Aboriginal versus non-Aboriginal participants relating to socio-demographic factors, health risk factors, current and past medical and surgical history, physical disability, functional health limitations and levels of current psychological distress were calculated using unconditional logistic regression, with adjustments for age and sex. Overall, 1939 of 266,661 45 and Up Study participants examined in this study identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander (0.7%). Compared to non-Aboriginal participants, Aboriginal participants were significantly more likely to be: younger (mean age 58 versus 63 years); without formal educational qualifications (age- and sex- adjusted OR=6.2, 95% CI 5.3-7.3); of unemployed (3.7, 2.9-4.6) or disabled (4.6, 3.9-5.3) work status; and with a household income< $20,000/year versus ≥$70,000/year (5.8, 5.0-6.9). Following additional adjustment for income and education, Aboriginal participants were significantly more likely than non-Aboriginal participants to: be current smokers (2.4, 2.0-2.8), be obese (2.1, 1.8-2.5), have ever been diagnosed with certain medical conditions (especially: diabetes [2.1, 1.8-2.4]; depression [1.6, 1.4-1.8] and stroke [1.8, 1.4-2.3]), have care-giving responsibilities (1.8, 1.5-2.2); have a major physical disability (2.6, 2.2-3.1); have severe physical functional limitation (2.9, 2.4-3.4) and have very high levels of psychological distress (2.4, 2.0-3.0). Aboriginal participants from the 45 and Up Study experience greater levels of disadvantage and have greater health needs (including physical disability and psychological distress) compared to non-Aboriginal participants. The study highlights the need to address the social determinants of health in Australia and to provide appropriate mental health services and disability support for older Aboriginal people.}

Data from 40-74 year old participants in the 2007/08 Jamaica Health and Lifestyle Survey were used. Trained interviewers administered questionnaires and measured anthropometrics, blood pressure, fasting glucose and cholesterol. Education and occupation were used to assess socioeconomic status. The Americas B tables were used to estimate the WHO/ISH 10 year CVD risk scores for the population. Weighted prevalence estimates were calculated. Data from 1,432 (450 men, 982 women) participants were analysed, after excluding those with self-reported heart attack and stroke. The women had a higher prevalence of diabetes (19%W;12%M), hypertension (49%W;47%M), hypercholesterolemia (25%W;11%M), obesity (46%W;15%M) and physical inactivity (59%W;29%M). More men smoked (6%W;31%M). There was good agreement between the 10-year cardiovascular risk estimates whether or not cholesterol measurements were utilized for calculation (kappa -0.61). While 90% had a 10 year WHO/ISH CVD risk of less than 10%, approximately 2% of the population or 14,000 persons had a 10 year WHO/ISH CVD risk of ≥30%. As expected CVD risk increased with age but there was no sex difference in CVD risk distribution despite women having a greater risk factor burden. Women with low socioeconomic status had the most adverse CVD risk profile. Despite women having a higher prevalence of CVD risk factors there was no sex difference in 10-year WHO/ISH CVD risk in Jamaican adults.}

The aneurysms were divided into two groups with respect to arterial branch: related (ophthalmic and superior hypophyseal artery), and non-related. Medical records were reviewed concerning multiple variables, such as sex, age, hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus, smoking and aneurysmal factors (size, arterial relationship, multiplicity and the occurrence of rupture and growth). The cumulative risk and the risk factors of aneurysmal rupture and growth were analysed. Two aneurysmal (0.35%) ruptures and 17 growths (3.0%) were observed during the follow-up of 1675.5 aneurysm-years with an annual rupture of 0.12% and an annual growth of 1.01%. The cumulative survival without aneurysmal growth reached a significant difference in aneurysms ≥4 mm (p=0.001), HTN (p=0.002), and arterial branch-related location (p=0.001). Multivariate analysis disclosed that aneurysm ≥4 mm (HR, 4.41; p=0.003), HTN (HR, 5.74; p=0.003), arterial branch-related location (HR, 6.04; p=0.002), and multiplicity (HR, 0.27; p=0.042) were significant predictive factors for aneurysm growth. Although incidental small paraclinoid UIAs have a relatively lower rupture and growth risk, patients with high-risk factors, including aneurysm ≥4 mm, HTN, arterial branch-related aneurysms, and multiple aneurysms must be monitored closely. The limitation of the retrospective nature of this study should be taken into consideration.}

All the inclusive patients underwent 3-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography and duplex color Doppler ultrasound or contrast-enhanced MR angiography to document the presence of intracranial or extracranial stenosis. Intracranial large-artery atherosclerosis was defined as ≥50% diameter reduction on MR angiography. The proportion of patients with ICAS was significantly higher in north China than in south China (50.22% versus 41.88%; P<0.0001). Patients in the north were likely to consume more alcohol and smoke more cigarettes and had significantly higher proportion of diabetes mellitus, family history of stroke, history of cerebral ischemia, heart disease, and higher body mass index. In patients aged >63 years, the percentage of ICAS in women was notably higher than in men (51.51% versus 45.40%; P=0.028). In elderly patients, women had higher proportion of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and heart disease than men. There exists geographic and sex difference in the distribution of symptomatic ICAS in China.

Patients were categorized by time of symptom onset: early (6 am-2 pm), late day (2 pm-10 pm), and overnight (10 pm-6 am) then evaluated for variations in characteristics. A circadian variation in the timing of symptom onset of STEMI was observed (early 41%, late day 32%, and overnight 26%, P<0.001). Circadian variations in factors known to alter timing of events were seen, including lower rates of home β-blocker use, smoking, and diabetes, with early onset of STEMI symptoms. In addition, patients in the 6 am to 2 pm subgroup were more likely older, white race, and male, with higher rates of home aspirin use and lower rates of obesity. Higher rates of coexisting cardiovascular disease, including prior heart failure, 3-vessel coronary artery disease, and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, were observed in the overnight group. More robust antiplatelet therapy with home clopidogrel use was not associated with a change in the timing of events. A morning excess of STEMI continues to exist and represents a potential target for preventative strategies. Patient baseline characteristics vary with the onset of STEMI and may reflect a physiologic relationship between these factors and the timing of events.}

Clinical data between the periods of June 2007 to February 2010 were collected from electronic medical records at 2 separate clinics at Kaiser Permanente (KP) Northern California, 1 with primary care physicians only (control group) and the other with the addition of a pharmacist (enhanced care group). Patients in the enhanced care group were matched 1:1 with patients in the control group according to baseline characteristics that included age, gender, A1c, and Charlson comorbidity score. The estimated 10-year CVD risk for both groups was calculated by the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Risk Engine (version 2) based on age, sex, race, smoking status, atrial fibrillation, duration of diabetes, levels of A1c, systolic BP (SBP) and TC, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) observed at 12 months. There was no statistical difference in the baseline clinical inputs to the Risk Engine (A1c [P=0.115], SBP [P=0.184], TC [P=0.055], and HDL-C [P=0.475]) between the 2 groups. A Markov model was developed to simulate the estimated CVD outcomes over 10 years and to estimate cost-effectiveness. The final outcomes examined included incremental cost and effectiveness measured by life years and per quality-adjusted life year gained. Both deterministic sensitivity analysis (SA) and probabilistic SA were conducted to examine the robustness of the results. The estimated risks for coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke (both nonfatal and fatal) at the end of the follow-up were consistently lower in the enhanced care group compared with the control group, even though baseline risks in both groups were similar. The absolute risk reduction (ARR) between the enhanced care and control groups increased over time. For example, the ARR for nonfatal CHD risk in year 1 was 0.5% (1.2% vs. 0.7%), whereas the ARR increased to 5.5% in year 10 (14.8% vs. 9.3%). Similarly, the ARR between the enhanced care and the control groups was calculated as 0.3% for fatal CHD in year 1 and increased to 4.6% in year 10. Results from the Markov model suggest that the enhanced care group was shown to be a dominant strategy (less expensive and more effective) compared with the control group in the 10-year evaluation period in the base-case (average or mean results) scenario. Sensitivity analysis that took into account the uncertainty in all important variables, such as wage of pharmacists, utility weight (the degree of preference individuals have for a particular health state or condition), response rate to pharmacists' care, and uncertainty associated with the estimated 10 years of CVD risk, revealed that the relative value of enhanced care was robust to most of the variations in these parameters. Notably, the level of cost-effectiveness measured by net monetary value depends on the time horizon adopted by the payers and the magnitude of CVD risk reduction. The enhanced care group has a higher chance of being considered as a cost-effective strategy when a longer time horizon such as a minimum of 4 to 5 years is adopted. Adding pharmacists to the health care management team for diabetic patients improves the long-term CVD risks. The longer-term CVD risk reductions were shown to be more dramatic than the short-term reduction. A longer time horizon adopted by health plans in managing T2DM patients has a higher probability of making the intervention cost-effective.}

  abstract = {This study examines how obesity is distributed across socio-economic gradients, and investigates the relationship between obesity and obesity-related chronic diseases in rural Yunnan province of China. The study design is a cross-sectional community survey. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three rural areas of Yunnan province between 2008 and 2010, among 10,007 consenting individuals aged ≥18 years. Information on demographic characteristics, smoking and drinking habits, self-reported stroke and ischemic heart disease (IHD), and family history of obesity-related chronic diseases was obtained using a standard questionnaire. Fasting blood sugar level, blood pressure, height, weight, and waist and hip circumference measurements were recorded for each individual. The age-standardized prevalence of obesity and central obesity was 8.8% and 46.0% among the study populations, respectively. Obesity and central obesity were more common in females than in males. After adjusting for age, sex, and current smoking and drinking status, individuals who belonged to an ethnic minority group had a lower probability of being both obese and centrally obese. Educational level was found to be negatively associated with the prevalence of obesity, and yearly household income was found to be positively associated with prevalence of central obesity. The results of logistic regression analysis indicated that obese and centrally obese people were more likely to suffer from diabetes, hypertension, and stoke. A positive association of IHD was only found in centrally obese people. In order to reduce the obesity epidemic in rural southwest China, effective interventions must address socio-economic factors. Reducing obesity has a profound impact on the reduction of morbidity associated with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.}

We retrospectively reviewed a clinical database of 1,498 patients (male/female = 1133/365, age 67 ± 9 years) who underwent CABG at Fukuoka University Hospital from 1994 to 2010. Male showed significantly younger, higher percentages (%) of smoking and hyperuricemia (HU), higher levels of serum creatinine, and lower % hypertension (HT) and diabetes mellitus (DM), and lower levels of left ventricular ejection fraction than female. In multivariate analysis, all parameters identified independent variables associated with the gender difference. Next, we divided the patients into 5 groups according to age, and each group was then separated by gender. The % of males significantly decreased with aging, whereas % female significantly increased. Although % smoking and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and body mass index (BMI) in all patients, males and females significantly decreased with aging, HU, left ventricular end diastolic pressure and the number of significantly stenosed coronary vessels were not associated with gender or aging. Interestingly, % HT in all patients and males significantly increased with aging, whereas that in females was not associated with aging. Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in males significantly decreased with aging, while those in all patients and females were not associated with aging. In this contemporary data set, the decreases in % smoking and eGFR with aging were common characteristics in male and female patients. In addition, there were gender and aging differences in % smoking, % HT, BMI and eGFR, whereas no differences were observed in % DM, % dyslipidemia or % HU. Before CABG, high-risk patients with coronary artery disease who is going to undergo CABG may need to be managed more strictly considering to gender and age to avoid CABG.}

Genotyping of platelet GP Ia C807Tpolymorphisms was performed by polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing nucleic acid with dideoxy chain-termination method and an ABI PRISM3100 (Perkin-Elmer Co) genetic analyzer. Student's t-test, chi-square test, and logistic regression modeling were used for data significance analyses. Hypertension and smoking were found to be the independent risk factors for ischemic stroke patients (aged </= 50 years), while hypertension, diabetes and smoking were the independent risk factors for ischemic stroke patients (aged > 50 years). There was no significant difference observed in the T allele frequency of GPIa C807T polymorphisms between young stroke patients and corresponding controls. These findings suggest that there is no role of GPIa C807T polymorphisms in the development of young first-ever ischemic stroke in Chinese Han Population.}

However, female patients were less likely to drink heavily (1.0% vs 31.6%, P < 0.001) or smoke (4.4% vs 59.9%, P < 0.001) than the male patients. The rates of smoking and heavy drinking in young adult group were higher than that in other two groups. Patients in very old group had higher prevalence of heart diseases and AF but lower proportion of positive family cardiovascular diseases history than patients in other two groups. HT and DM were equally frequent among three groups. In young adult group, female patients were more likely to have heart diseases and family history of heart diseases (P = 0.015 and P = 0.048). In middle-old group, HT, DM, heart disease and AF were more common in women than in men (P = 0.021, P = 0.004, P = 0.001 and P = 0.039). There are differences in risk factor distribution in patients with first-ever IS of different age and gender.

However, population based studies have shown no difference between those with and those without diabetes in the subtypes of stroke. We determined the rates and predictors of risk of stroke and its subtypes in the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) trial. 9795 patients aged 50-75 years with type 2 diabetes were followed up for a median of 5 years. Annual rates were derived by the Kaplan-Meier method and independent predictors of risk by Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. The annual rate of stroke was 6.7 per 1000 person years; 82% were ischaemic and caused by small artery disease (36%), large artery disease (17%) and embolism from the heart (13%); 10% were haemorrhagic. Among the strongest baseline predictors of ischaemic or unknown stroke were age (60-65 years, HR 1.98; >65 years, HR 2.35) and a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) (HR 2.06). Other independent baseline predictors were male sex, smoking, history of hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, nephropathy, systolic blood pressure and blood low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, HbA(1c) and fibrinogen. A history of peripheral vascular disease, low high density lipoprotein, age and history of hypertension were associated with large artery ischaemic stroke. A history of diabetic retinopathy, LDL cholesterol, male sex, systolic blood pressure, smoking, diabetes duration and a history of stroke or TIA were associated with small artery ischaemic stroke. Older people with a history of stroke were at highest risk of stroke, but the prognosis and prognostic factors of subtypes were heterogeneous. The results will help clinicians quantify the absolute risk of stroke and its subtypes for typical diabetes patients.}

All cause mortality. Before diagnosis, 12,379 (9.8%) patients had established cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or stroke). During a median follow-up of 3.5 years, we recorded 25,495 (20.2%) deaths. In people with cardiovascular disease, tight control of systolic (<130 mm Hg) and diastolic (<80 mm Hg) blood pressure was not associated with improved survival, after adjustment for baseline characteristics (age at diagnosis, sex, practice level clustering, deprivation score, body mass index, smoking, HbA(1c) and cholesterol levels, and blood pressure). Low blood pressure was also associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality. Compared with patients who received usual control of systolic blood pressure (130-139 mm Hg), the hazard ratio of all cause mortality was 2.79 (95% confidence interval 1.74 to 4.48, P<0.001) for systolic blood pressure at 110 mm Hg. Compared with patients who received usual control of diastolic blood pressure (80-84 mm Hg), the hazard ratios were 1.32 (1.02 to 1.78, P=0.04) and 1.89 (1.40 to 2.56, P<0.001) for diastolic blood pressures at 70-74 mm Hg and lower than 70 mm Hg, respectively. Similar associations were found in people without cardiovascular disease. Subgroup analyses of people diagnosed with hypertension and who received treatment for hypertension confirmed initial findings. Blood pressure below 130/80 mm Hg was not associated with reduced risk of all cause mortality in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, with or without known cardiovascular disease. Low blood pressure, particularly below 110/75 mm Hg, was associated with an increased risk for poor outcomes.}

In this study population with previous MI an elevated hs-CRP > 3 mg/l and left ventricular dysfunction were significant predictors of CV death, recurrent MI, stroke and unstable angina pectoris, independent of baseline characteristics and medical treatment. Data from the study suggest that hs-CRP levels ≥ 3 mg/l and baseline ejections fraction can be used to stratify individuals at high risk of adverse CV events from patients with stable and asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD).}

We analyzed how differences in long-term survival between diabetic and nondiabetic stroke patients have changed over time, and if differences varied with respect to sex and age. This population-based study included 12,375 first-ever stroke patients, 25-74 years old, who were registered in the Northern Sweden MONICA Stroke Registry 1985-2005. Uniform diagnostic criteria for stroke case ascertainment were used throughout the study period. The diagnosis of diabetes was based on medical records or diabetes diagnosed during the acute stroke event. Patients were separated into four cohorts according to year of stroke and followed for survival until August 30, 2008. The diabetes prevalence at stroke onset was 21%, similar in men and women, and remained stable throughout the study period. The diabetic patients were an average of 2 years older, more often nonsmokers and more likely to have antihypertensive treatment, antithrombotics, atrial fibrillation, and a history of myocardial infarction or transient ischemic attack than the nondiabetic patients. The total follow-up time was 86,086 patient-years during which a total of 1,930 (75.7%) of the diabetic patients and 5,744 (58.5%) of the nondiabetic patients died (p < 0.001). Median survival was 60 months (95% CI: 57-64) in diabetic patients and 117 months (113-120) in the nondiabetic patients. Survival improved significantly in both groups (p < 0.001). A Cox regression, adjusting for possible confounders (age, sex, antihypertensive medication, antithrombotics or other thrombolytic agents, history of myocardial infarction, type of stroke, diabetes, cohort and the diabetes-by-sex, diabetes-by-age and diabetes-by-cohort interactions), showed a hazard ratio of 1.67 (1.58-1.76) comparing survival in diabetic versus nondiabetic patients. The reduced survival in diabetic stroke patients was more pronounced in women (p = 0.02) and younger patients (p < 0.001). There was a tendency that the difference in survival decreased between the earlier cohorts and the 2000-2005 cohort, but the test for interaction did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08). Long-term survival after a first stroke has improved in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Survival is markedly lower in diabetics, especially in women and younger patients, and the disparity persisted over 24 years. Decreasing the disparity in stroke survival is a challenge for stroke and diabetes care. New treatment methods in combination with intense secondary prevention in diabetic patients, especially in younger women, are needed.}

Geographic regions were defined as northern (Finland, Norway), central (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, The Netherlands, Switzerland), and southern (Greece, Italy, Turkey) Europe. Hierarchical regression models were used for comparisons. In the study cohort (n=3944), the 3 most frequent risk factors were current smoking (48.7%), dyslipidemia (45.8%), and hypertension (35.9%). Compared with central (n=1868; median age, 43 years) and northern (n=1330; median age, 44 years) European patients, southern Europeans (n=746; median age, 41 years) were younger. No sex difference emerged between the regions, male:female ratio being 0.7 in those aged <34 years and reaching 1.7 in those aged 45 to 49 years. After accounting for confounders, no risk-factor differences emerged at the region level. Compared with females, males were older and they more frequently had dyslipidemia or coronary heart disease, or were smokers, irrespective of region. In both sexes, prevalence of family history of stroke, dyslipidemia, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and atrial fibrillation positively correlated with age across all regions. Primary preventive strategies for ischemic stroke in young adults-having high rate of modifiable risk factors-should be targeted according to sex and age at continental level.}

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of some factors such as serum levels of homocysteine, folate and B12 vitamin with stroke in acute ischemic stroke patients. In this case control study, serum levels of homocysteine, folate and B12 vitamin in 93 patients with acute ischemic stroke admitted to Imam Khomeini Hospital between September 2008 and January 2010, and 93 healthy controls were measured. Cerebrovascular risk factors including age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, diabetes mellitus, alcohol consumption, coronary artery disease and obesity were recorded. The results were compared between the case and control groups. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) of fasting total homocysteine (tHcy) level in acute ischemic stroke patients was 20.58 ± 19.6 µmol/l, which was significantly higher than that of control group being 14.11 ± 9.5 µmol/l (P = 0.002). 39 (41.9%) stroke cases and 25 (26.8%) controls had hyperhomocysteinemia. There were no significant relationships between tHcy, folate and B12 vitamin levels with the above mentioned cerebrovascular risk factors except for smoking (p> 0.05). No significant difference in B12 vitamin and folate levels between patients and healthy controls were detected (P> 0.05). Hyperhomocysteinemia is common in Iranian patients with acute ischemic stroke and might play a role as an independent risk factor in stroke.}

  abstract = {To estimate the relationship between the risk stratification of patients with diabetes and their clinical endpoint events. In this cohort study, we prospectively followed 8302 individuals under the following situations:contents of fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L, being diagnosed as diabetes or having used hypoglycemic drugs from Kailuan study in which 101 510 employees (81 110 males, 20 400 females, who were being employed and those retired from the company were included) from the Kailuan Company, were screened. During the 38 - 53 (48.01 ± 3.14) months of follow-up period, a new heart or cerebrovascular events were ascertained every six months. The impacts of different risk stratification in diabetic population on the incidence rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events were estimated. Using the definitions of "people with ischemic cardiovascular disease incidence of 10-year risk assessment methods" developed by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, the study cohort was divided into four groups, namely, very low-risk, low risk, medium risk and high risk. (1) Along with the increasing risk of the disease, the incidence rates of total cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death and all-cause death rate also gradually increased and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.01). However, the difference on incidence rate of sudden death was not significantly different (P > 0.05). (2) Compared to the very low-risk group, the age and sex adjusted relative risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events were 1.42 (95%CI: 1.02 - 1.96, P < 0.05), 2.26 (95%CI: 1.67 - 3.04, P < 0.01) for those with medium and high risk groups, respectively. In diabetic patients, those risk factors as age, hypertension, body mass index, total cholesterol and smoking having been used on ischemic cardiovascular disease, could also be used to predict the occurrence of cardiovascular events. Along with the increasing risk factors, the risk of cardiovascular events incidence also increased.}

To study the differences in the pathogenesis of intracranial stenosis in younger patients as compared to the older population. The clinical characteristics of patients with angiographically confirmed intracranial stenosis were matched to a healthy population using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study (NHANES). The study population was stratified into two age groups (≤45 and >45 years). The relative risk (odds ratios) and attributable risk of known cardiovascular risk factors were estimated. A total of 17 (11%) patients from 153 patients with intracranial stenosis were aged ≤45 years. These patients were more likely to be women (53 vs. 28%, p < 0.05). The location of the lesion in the young patients was more likely to be in the internal carotid artery (65 vs. 29%, p < 0.05). When compared with the stroke risk factors from the NHANES control population, the attributable risk of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease for intracranial stenosis was lower among patients aged ≤45 years than that for patients aged >45 years (6.4 vs. 13.1%, 19.9 vs. 33.0% and 1.0 vs. 10.8%, respectively). Hyperlipidemia had a greater attributable risk of intracranial stenosis in patients ≤45 than in those >45 years of age (23.3 vs. 9.3%). Intracranial stenosis in young patients is predominantly located in the anterior circulation and more frequently occurs in young women. Even though the stroke risk factors appear to be strongly associated with intracranial stenosis in this age group, the impact of these risk factors is low due to the low prevalence.}

Consecutive sample of patients with stroke (N=33; mean age ± SD, 59.0±11.3 y). Not applicable. Peak oxygen consumption (VO(2)peak) and oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) were determined during a symptom-limited graded cycle ergometer test at 3, 6, and 12 months poststroke. Age, sex, premorbid physical activity level, clinical history (smoking, diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary diseases, cardiovascular diseases, overweight, and hypertension), stroke type and area, side of lesion, and assessments of stroke severity were evaluated at intake. Mean VO(2)peak ± SD was 18.1±6.6 mL·kg(-1)·min(-1), 19.8±8.0 mL·kg(-1)·min(-1), and 19.7±8.4 mL·kg(-1)·min(-1) at 3, 6, and 12 months poststroke. Values for OUES were 1575.3±638.3, 1710.7±710.3, and 1687.2±777.5, respectively. Mixed models showed no significant difference over time for VO(2)peak (P=.10), nor for the logarithm of OUES (P=.09). Stroke survivors at risk of deconditioning were premorbidly less active at work or in sport activities, diabetic, or initially more severely impaired. Combination of factors revealed that older patients with stroke and diabetes were less likely to improve on VO(2)peak and that older, women, diabetic nonsmokers improved less on log OUES. Cardiorespiratory fitness was reduced from 3 to 12 months poststroke and on average did not significantly change over time. Further studies should elucidate methods of increasing cardiorespiratory fitness during stay in the rehabilitation center and how community-based aerobic exercise training postrehabilitation can be organized.}

Clinical assessment was performed which included fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, systemic blood pressure, body mass index, smoking, circulating blood lipids and oral glucose tolerance test. In addition, documented presence of ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia were determined from medical files. The average age of the 287 participants was 51.2 ± 0.6 years (56.8% women). Mean IMT(12_seg) was 0.80 ± 0.17 mm (range: 0.55-1.47 mm). Compared with disease free Inuit, individuals with history of stroke showed greater carotid internal IMT (0.68 ± 0.01 mm vs. 0.96 ± 0.15 mm respectively; p<0.005) but no difference was observed for IHD. Hypertensive and dyslipidemic Inuit had higher IMT(12_seg) compared to risk factor free individuals but no difference was observed in diabetics. None of the clinical assessments were associated with IMT(12_seg). In a multivariate backward elimination model, only age, gender, and medically documented history of hypertension were found to be predictors of IMT(12_seg) (adjusted r-square of 0.54; p<0.0001). Compared with disease free Nunavik Inuit, subclinical signs of atherosclerosis determined by IMT was higher in individual diagnosed with stroke. Independent predictors of IMT(12_seg) in our group were age, gender and history of hypertension. No other traditional risk factors imparted IMT.}

We investigated the potential effect on population cardiovascular risk and associated costs of single and multi-factorial intervention, to target levels, in individuals with T2DM. Baseline population means and proportions for cardiovascular risk factors were calculated for 159 patients with T2DM from 3 general practices. Predicted 10year cardiovascular risk, and associated costs were calculated using the LIP2687 risk calculator, based on Framingham and UKPDS equations. Systolic blood pressure, HbA(1C), total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol were altered to NICE and SIGN target levels and the model run again. The difference in outcomes was observed. 45%, 76% and 38% of patients met NICE targets for cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and HbA1c, respectively. As expected, comparing the two guidelines, fewer patients met the 'stricter' targets (P=0.0001). Treatment-to-target produced no significant difference in cardiovascular risk or costs, although greater reductions in outcomes were seen with multi-factorial intervention. This small study suggests that intervention in only those patients with the highest cardiovascular risk brings little reduction in population cardiovascular risk and associated health costs. Multi-factorial intervention in all patients with T2DM, regardless of baseline values, is likely to bring greater reductions. This raises the question as to whether the current emphasis on treatment to target should be modified to encourage multi-factorial intervention in all patients with T2DM, even those with baseline values below target levels.}

The primary objectives of this observational study were to compare patients with ACS hospitalized in the Arab Middle East to patients enrolled in a multinational non-Arabian ACS registry. The study cohort consisted of patients hospitalized in 2007 with an ACS including 4,445 from the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) and 6,706 from the Gulf Registry of Acute Coronary Events (Gulf RACE). Average age of patients in Gulf RACE was nearly a decade younger than that in GRACE (56 vs 66 years). Patients in Gulf RACE were more likely to be men, diabetic, and smoke and less likely to be hypertensive compared to patients in GRACE. Patients in Gulf RACE had higher odds of receiving aspirin and a lower likelihood of receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, β blockers, and clopidogrel during their index hospitalization. Although most eligible patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction in Gulf RACE received thrombolytics, most of their counterparts in GRACE underwent a primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Multivariable adjusted in-hospital case-fatality rates were not significantly different between patients in Gulf RACE and those in GRACE. In conclusion, despite differences in patient characteristics and treatment practices, short-term mortality rates were comparable in patients with ACS enrolled in these 2 registries. Future studies should explore the effects of these differences on long-term prognosis and other pertinent patient outcomes.}

Acute symptomatic BSIs were explored on radiologic images and classified into multiple infarctions with BSIs, multifocal BSIs, and monofocal BSIs. Isolated BSIs were further classified based on the vertical distribution into midbrain, pontine, and medullary infarctions, and on the horizontal distribution into anterior-dominant, posterior-dominant, and anterior/posterior BSIs. Neurologic symptoms of BSIs and clinical background were compared between DM and non-DM patients. The prevalence of BSIs was 2.6-fold higher (P < .0001) in DM patients. Logistic regression analysis including age, sex, smoking, previous stroke, atrial fibrillation, other cardiac diseases, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and DM showed that DM was independently associated with BSIs (odds ratio [OR] 2.814; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.936-4.090; P < .0001). Compared with non-DM patients, DM patients showed more frequent monofocal BSIs (P < .0001) and multifocal BSIs (P = .0296). Monofocal BSIs (n = 114) more frequently involved the pons (P < .0001) and medulla (P = .0212). Anterior-dominant BSIs (P < .0001) were more common in DM patients than in non-DM patients. Symptoms of BSIs included more frequent motor paresis (P = .0180) and less frequent diplopia (P = .0298) in DM patients than in non-DM patients.

We cross-sectionally included 240 consecutive patients with no history of stroke. We measured the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), ankle brachial pressure index, and intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery, and we performed magnetic resonance brain imaging. WMHs were defined as periventricular hyperintensity (Fazekas grade ≥3) and/or separate deep white matter hyperintense signals (Fazekas grade ≥2). We determined the prevalence of WMHs, silent brain infarction (SBI), hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and smoking. We compared 2 groups of patients, defined by the presence or absence of WMHs, using multiple logistic regression analyses. In multivariable analysis, SBI (OR 3.38; 95% CI 1.52-7.72), hypertension (OR 2.23; 95% CI 1.03-5.15), female sex (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.03-3.76), baPWV (OR 1.12; 95% CI 1.02-1.23), and age (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.04-1.14) were independently associated with WMHs. An increased baPWV is associated with WMHs. Management of increased baPWV may help to prevent the progression of WMHs and stroke.}

Fewer women underwent revascularization procedures, including thrombolytic therapy, balloon angioplasty, stent implantation, and coronary artery bypass grafting (79.4% vs. 83.3% men, p<0.001). No significant differences were observed in CVD-related death, recurrent ACS, stroke, refractory angina, or rehospitalization for angina. Female ACS patients were older than male subjects and had more atypical presentation.

  abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an important risk factor for stroke and overall mortality, but information about the preventable burden of AF is lacking. The aim of this study was to determine what proportion of the burden of AF in blacks and whites could theoretically be avoided by the maintenance of an optimal risk profile. This study included 14 598 middle-aged Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study cohort members. Previously established AF risk factors, namely high blood pressure, elevated body mass index, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, and prior cardiac disease, were categorized into optimal, borderline, and elevated levels. On the basis of their risk factor levels, individuals were classified into 1 of these 3 groups. The population-attributable fraction of AF resulting from having a nonoptimal risk profile was estimated separately for black and white men and women. During a mean follow-up of 17.1 years, 1520 cases of incident AF were identified. The age-adjusted incidence rates were highest in white men and lowest in black women (7.45 and 3.67 per 1000 person-years, respectively). The overall prevalence of an optimal risk profile was 5.4% but varied according to race and gender: 10% in white women versus 1.6% in black men. Overall, 56.5% of AF cases could be explained by having ≥ 1 borderline or elevated risk factors, of which elevated blood pressure was the most important contributor. As with other forms of cardiovascular disease, more than half of the AF burden is potentially avoidable through the optimization of cardiovascular risk factors levels.}

We reviewed 2,644 patients (2,188 males, 456 females) who underwent primary angioplasty for STEMI between October 2003 and March 2008. Data on female patients concerning demographic and clinical characteristics, primary angioplasty results, in-hospital and 25-month follow-up results were compared with those of male patients. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, anemia, shock, and renal failure were more common in female patients, while smoking was more frequent in males (p<0.05). The mean age was higher in female patients (63.9±11.7 vs. 55.2±11.3 years, p<0.001). Females also presented with higher values of glucose, mean platelet volume, and platelet count, and lower hemoglobin and hematocrit values (p<0.05). The frequencies of multivessel disease and procedure failure were significantly higher, and pain-to-balloon time was significantly longer in females (p<0.05). Mortality associated with cardiovascular causes occurred in 148 patients (5.6%), being significantly higher in females (9.4% vs. 4.8%, p<0.001). In-hospital mortality, major cardiac events, stroke, cardiogenic shock, and major bleeding were more frequent in women (p<0.05). Long-term mortality rate was also significantly higher in females (10% vs. 4.5%, p<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed female gender as one of the independent predictors of mortality (odds ratio=1.75, 95% CI 1.02-2.99; p<0.04). Female patients with STEMI undergoing primary angioplasty have a higher risk profile and poorer in-hospital and follow-up clinical results. Therefore, female patients should be treated more aggressively.}

The study was a cluster-randomized clinical trial that included 41 primary care practices, the majority in the Midwest, using Family Healthware, a self-administered, Web-based tool that assesses familial risk for the diseases and provides personalized risk-tailored messages. Patients in the control group received an age- and sex-specific health message related to lifestyle and screening. Smoking cessation, fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity, aspirin use, blood pressure, and cholesterol and blood glucose screening were assessed at baseline and 6 months after the intervention. Of 4,248 participants, 3,344 (78%) completed the study. Participants were white (91%), female (70%), and insured (97%), and had a mean age of 50.6 years (range 35-65 years). Intervention participants were more likely to increase daily fruit and vegetable consumption from 5 or fewer servings a day to 5 or more servings a day (OR = 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.58) and to increase physical activity (OR = 1.47; 95% CI, 1.08-1.98) to 5 to 6 times a week for 30 minutes or more a week. The absolute differences in proportion were 3% and 4%, respectively. Intervention participants were less likely to move from not having cholesterol screening in the last 5 years to having their cholesterol measured within 5 years (OR = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.17-0.67), with an absolute difference of 15%. Messages tailored to an individual's familial risk for 6 common diseases modestly increased self-reported physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake but reduced the likelihood of receiving cholesterol screening.}

Natural population from communities in several cities and districts including Beijing, Shanghai, Changsha, Guangdong, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang in China were investigated as study subjects through cluster multistage and random sampling. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured among participants in the communities by trained investigators and correlative information and clinical data were collected. PAD was defined as an ABI≤0.9 in either leg. 21,152 eligible participants were included in the survey. The prevalence in males and females was 2.52 % and 3.66 %, the standardized prevalence was 1.84% and 4.31% respectively, and the prevalence in females was higher than that in males (p<0.01). The prevalence in females obviously increased (p<0.01) with increasing age. More female participants with PAD were over 69 years old compared with those without PAD (18.8% vs. 10.0%, p=0.000) and more frequently have a smoking habit (11.1% vs. 2.5%, p=0.000), lipid disorders (34.8% vs. 29.2%, p=0.047), diabetes mellitus (14.8% vs. 8.6%, p=0.000), coronary heart disease (16.9% vs. 10.0%, p=0.000) and a history of stroke (6.8% vs. 2.3%, p=0.000). Using multiple logistic regression analysis, older age (>69 years old, OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.11-2.29), a smoking habit (OR: 5.98, 95% CI: 3.88-9.21), comorbidities of lipid disorders (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.10-1.91), diabetes mellitus (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.02-2.11), coronary heart disease (OR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.02-2.19)and a history of stroke (OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.01-2.91) were correlated with the prevalence of PAD in females in China. Only 0.8% of female patients with PAD had been diagnosed previously. The data suggest that the prevalence of PAD in a female natural population in China is higher than that in males. Many conventional risk factors and comorbidities were correlated with the high prevalence of PAD in females. But only very few female patients with PAD were diagnosed. Thus, more measures should be taken to diagnose, prevent and control PAD in females in China.}

The Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) Registry is a prospective study of 67 888 subjects with either established atherothrombotic (coronary, cerebrovascular, and/or peripheral arterial) disease or multiple atherothrombotic risk factors enrolled from 5587 physician practices in 44 countries. At baseline, AEL (0 to 8 years, 9 to 12 years, trade or technical school, and university) was self-reported for 61 332 subjects. Outcomes included the baseline prevalence of atherothrombotic risk factors and the rate of incident cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke) through 23 months across AEL groups, stratified by sex and world region (LMICs or HICs). Educational attainment was inversely associated with age and diabetes mellitus and directly associated with hypercholesterolemia in all subjects. However, for other risk factors such as obesity, smoking, hypertension, and baseline burden of vascular disease, AEL was protective (inversely associated) in HICs but not protective in LMICs. The protective effect of greater AEL on incident cardiovascular events was strongest in men from HICs (P<0.0001), more modest in women from HICs (P=0.0026) and in men from LMICs (P=0.082), and essentially absent in women from LMICs (P=0.32). In contrast to HICs, higher AEL may not be protective against cardiovascular events in LMICs, particularly in women.}

We identified 93 crack-cocaine cases and 93 controls admitted between January 2004 and May 2006 to one teaching hospital. There were significant differences between crack-cocaine cases and controls in age (48.7 years vs. 55 years) (P = 0.0001), male gender (65.6% vs. 40.9%) (odds ratios, OR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.22-2.21), arterial hypertension (61.1% vs. 83.9%) (OR = 0.30, 95% CI 0.15-0.60), hypercholesterolemia (18.7% vs. 68.5%) (OR = 0.10, 95% CI 0.05-0.21), diabetes (20.9% vs. 41.9%) (OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.19-0.70), cigarette smoking (70.6% vs. 29%) (OR = 5.86, 95% CI 3.07-11.20), ischemic stroke (61.3% vs. 79.6%) (OR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.21-0.78), and intracerebral hemorrhage (33.3% vs. 17.2%) (OR = 3.03, 95% CI 1.53-6.00). Also, there were significant differences in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores (3.3 vs. 7) (P < 0.0001), and MRS scores (1.8 vs. 2.5) (P = 0.0022) at hospital discharge. Using univariable and multivariable logistic regression, we found that crack-cocaine abusers had 2.28 higher odds of having a favorable functional outcome (MRS score ≤ 2) at hospital discharge, after adjusting for stroke risk factors and characteristics. Our study suggests that crack-cocaine abusers with stroke had fewer traditional risk factors, and more favorable functional outcome as compared to non-crack-cocaine abusers.}

The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at discharge were used to evaluate stroke severity. We determined the location of the infarct, the grade of white matter hyperintensity (WMH), and the prevalence of silent brain infarcts, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and smoking. We compared 2 groups, good outcome (mRS score 0-2) and poor outcome (mRS score 3-5), using multiple logistic regression analysis. We found significant differences between the 2 groups according to female sex (P = .04), WMH (P = .04), and NIHSS score (P < .001). After multivariate analysis, female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-11.4; P = .03), and NIHSS score (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.7-3.3; P < .001) were independently associated with poor outcome. Elderly onset, poor outcome, and hypercholesterolemia were more common in female patients, whereas smoking was more prevalent in males. Our data indicate that sex differences exist in Japanese LI patients with regard to risk factors and outcome. The treatment of risk factors based on sex differences is important to the management of LI.}

The Canadian population is becoming increasingly diverse because of immigration. Understanding ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk factors is critically important in planning appropriate prevention strategies for the country's rapidly changing population. We sought to examine the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in various Canadian ethnic groups. We analyzed 3 cross-sectional cycles (for 2000, 2003 and 2005) of the Canadian Community Health Survey of people aged 12 years and older. The surveys were conducted by means of self-reported questionnaires. We used stratified analysis to evaluate the relation between risk factors and ethnicity. The effect of participants' ethnicity on the prevalence of risk factors was estimated by means of logistic regression, with adjustment for differences in age, sex, marital status, education, household income, language spoken, immigration status, residency type (urban or rural), household size, region (province or territory) and chronic diseases (heart disease, stroke, cancer, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bowel disease, arthritis, epilepsy, ulcers, thyroid disease and diabetes mellitus). We included 371 154 individuals in the analysis. Compared with white people, people from visible minorities (i.e., neither white nor Aboriginal) had a lower prevalence of diabetes mellitus (4.5% v. 4.0%), hypertension (14.7% v. 10.8%), smoking (20.4% v. 9.7%) and obesity (defined as body mass index ≥ 30; 14.8% v. 9.7%) but a higher prevalence of physical inactivity (50.3% v. 58.1%). More specifically, after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, people from most visible minorities, in comparison with the white population, were less likely to smoke; were more likely to be physically inactive, with the exception of people of Korean, Japanese and Latin ethnicity; and were less likely to be obese, with the exception of people of black, Latin, Arab or West Asian ethnicity. However, relative to white people, hypertension was more prevalent among those of Filipino or South East Asian background (odds ratio [OR] 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-1.93) and those of black ancestry (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.43-2.00). Cardiovascular risk factors vary dramatically by ethnic group. Health professionals should increase their promotion of physical activity among visible minorities and should prioritize the detection and control of diabetes and hypertension during routine contact with patients of visible minorities, particularly those of South Asian, Filipino and black ethnicity.}

The associations between the dependent variable and sociodemographic characteristics, behavioral risk factors (smoking, consumption of fatty meat and whole milk, leisure-time physical inactivity, low fruit and vegetable intake and intake of added salt) and self-perceived health status were assessed in men and women using multinomial logistic regression. Chronic disease reporting was higher among older men and women with lower schooling, BMI > or = 30 kg/m2 and who were on a diet. There was an inverse association between number of risk behaviors and two or more chronic diseases (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.54;0.76 among men and OR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.77;0.97 among women). Those men (OR: 33.61; 95% CI: 15.70;71.93) and women (OR: 13.02; 95% CI: 6.86; 24.73) who self-perceived their health as poor reported more chronic diseases. There was no statistical interaction between self-perceived health status and gender. An inverse association between number of risk behaviors and reporting of two or more chronic diseases suggests a reverse causality and/or higher survival rates among those who take better care of themselves. Men seem to have poorer perception of their health status compared to women, after adjustment for confounders.}

Baseline lower BMI and absence of microalbuminuria were associated with tight control. Median difference of HbA1c/BP 1.6%/25/5 mmHg between tight and adverse control considerably reduced the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

To adjust for dissimilarities in preoperative risk profiles, propensity score-based matching was applied. Before adjustment, clinical outcomes in terms of operative mortality, arrhythmias, intensive care unit stay, and maximum creatine kinase-MB levels were significantly different for men and women. After balancing the preoperative characteristics, including height, no significant differences in clinical outcomes were observed. However, there was decreased use of internal mammary artery, less total arterial revascularization, and increasing creatine kinase-MB levels with decreasing height. This study supports the theory that female sex per se does not increase operative risk, but shorter height, which is more common in women, affects the outcome, probably due to technical difficulties in shorter patients with smaller internal mammary arteries and coronary vessels. Thus women may especially benefit from sequential arterial grafting.}

The relationship between MS and stroke was studied by multiple logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of MS increased along with age. The MS prevalence rates of the subjects with FPG > or = 5.6 mmol/L in the age groups 25 - 34, 35 - 44, 45 - 54, and > or = 55 were 23.5%, 37.2%, 45.7%, and 53.0% respectively, all significantly higher than those of the subjects with the FPG < 5.6 mmol/L (2.2%, 4.7%, 7.8%, and 9.5% respectively, all P < 0.01). The prevalence rates of stroke of the groups of DM, normal blood sugar with MS, mild hyperglycemia with MS, and DM with MS were 2.94%, 2.27%, 2.89%, and 4.11%, respectively, all significantly higher than that of the control group (0.19%, all P < 0.01). After adjustment for age, sex, smoking status, and LDL-C, no significant difference was observed between the neighboring MS groups (all P > 0.05). Compared to the group of MS with normoglycemia, the OR value for stroke of the DM with MS was 1.84 (95% CI 1.20 - 2.83, P < 0.01), which was still significant after adjusting for LDL-C (P < 0.05). (1) People with glucose intolerance had very high prevalence of stroke than novmoglgcemic people. (2) Hyperglycemia in MS has an extremely important role in the impact of MS on stroke in Chinese. (3) Diabetes by itself has the same significance as the combination of MS components in the development of stroke.}

Arab countries constitute populations with a similar lifestyle and diet that may influence stroke risk, type and survival after stroke, as well as other characteristics in comparison to Western and Oriental populations. Therefore, a review of published reports of stroke in Arab countries was undertaken to provide a background for designing future stroke studies in Arab populations. Thirty-one articles related to incidence, prevalence, types, risk factors and outcome of stroke in Arab countries were identified by keyword searching of Medline and Embase, and review of references in all relevant papers. Studies were available for Saudi Arabia (n=16), Qatar (n=4), Libya (n=3), Kuwait (n=2), Jordan (n=1), United Arab Emirates (n=1), Bahrain (n=1), Tunisia (n=1), Iraq (n=1), and Sudan (n=1). The publication dates ranged from 1983-2008. The annual stroke incidence ranged from 27.5 to 63 per 100,000 population and prevalence was between 42 and 68 per 100,000 population. Ischaemic stroke was the commonest subtype in all series. However, one series from Sudan had a 41% rate of intracerebral haemorrhage, which is more similar to East Asian countries. Non-lacunar infarction occurred more frequently than lacunar infarcts in all but two series. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, and cardiac disease were the commonest risk factors. The case-fatality rate at 30 days was between 10 and 17.5%. Therefore, the incidence and prevalence of stroke in Arab countries are lower than the Western world but within the range reported in Chinese populations. Stroke types and risk factors are similar, but an apparently higher rate of lacunar infarction in some settings needs further investigation. There is therefore a significant opportunity for further evaluation of stroke in Arab countries, especially in unstudied areas such as the populous countries of Egypt, Algeria, Syria, and Morocco.}

A total of 23,455 participants from the population-based European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam study aged 35-65 years and free of diabetes and major chronic diseases at baseline (1994-1998) were followed through 2006 for incident myocardial infarction, stroke, types of cancer, and death. Risk score points were assigned to each participant based on age, waist circumference, height, physical activity, history of hypertension, smoking, alcohol consumption, and intake of red meat, whole-grain bread, and coffee. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated by Cox regression models. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, participants with a high risk score (5-year probability to develop diabetes > or = 10%) had significantly higher risks of myocardial infarction (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.5-5.0) and stroke (1.9, 1.0-3.6), but not of colon, breast or prostate cancer incidence, than those with a low score (5-year probability < 1%). In addition, participants with a high risk score had considerably higher risks of cardiovascular (HR 4.6, 95% CI 2.3-9.4), cancer (1.7, 1.1-2.7), and total mortality (2.4, 1.8-3.4), the latter being equivalent to a difference in life expectancy of 13 years. These data indicate that a risk score predictive for type 2 diabetes is also related to elevated risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, and premature death in apparently healthy individuals and emphasize the need for early intervention in high-risk individuals.}

This positive association between CRP and diabetes risk did not change when participants were stratified by age group, smoking status, level of obesity, alcohol drinking habit, or family history of diabetes. High baseline level of serum CRP was associated with an increased risk of diabetes among both men and women, but this association was stronger in women than men.}

However, little is known about the global distribution of stroke and its relations to the prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors and sociodemographic and economic characteristics. National estimates of stroke mortality and burden (measured in disability-adjusted life years [DALYs]) were calculated from monitoring vital statistics, a systematic review of studies that report disease surveillance, and modelling as part of the WHO Global Burden of Disease programme. Similar methods were used to generate standardised measures of the national prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. Risk factors other than diabetes and disease burden estimates were age-adjusted and sex-adjusted to the WHO standard population. There was a ten-fold difference in rates of stroke mortality and DALY loss between the most-affected and the least-affected countries. Rates of stroke mortality and DALY loss were highest in eastern Europe, north Asia, central Africa, and the south Pacific. National per capita income was the strongest predictor of mortality and DALY loss rates (p<0.0001) even after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors (p<0.0001). Prevalences of cardiovascular risk factors measured at a national level were generally poor predictors of national stroke mortality rates and burden, although raised mean systolic blood pressure (p=0.028) and low body-mass index (p=0.017) predicted stroke mortality, and greater prevalence of smoking predicted both stroke mortality (p=0.041) and DALY-loss rates (p=0.034). Rates of stroke mortality and burden vary greatly among countries, but low-income countries are the most affected. Current measures of the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors at the population level poorly predict overall stroke mortality and burden and do not explain the greater burden in low-income countries.}

The American Stroke Association's patient management tool, Get with the Guidelines-Stroke (GGS) is widely used to increase adherence to quality indicators in stroke care, but it also provides an opportunity to analyze gender differences in the acute stroke setting. We used a state-wide database, based on GGS, to explore gender differences in stroke in Colorado. We analyze demographics, risk factors, lifestyles, treatments, and responses to treatment. Of 126 data elements examined, statistically significant gender differences were noted for 47 (37%). As compared to men, women in Colorado were older and more significantly impacted by acute stroke. Risk factor profiles differed between the 2 genders, with men having a higher incidence of coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes, carotid stenosis and tobacco smoking, while women had a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Lipids were less aggressively treated and antithrombotics were less commonly used in women. Overall, acute stroke treatment of women appeared "less aggressive" than for men. GGS may be used not only for quality improvement initiatives in individual hospitals. It can also give an overview of clinical aspects of stroke at a state level, and may shed light on gender differences.}

Male/female odds ratios (OR) for nonfatal stroke were calculated in three treatment groups: diet only 7,273/15,901, oral glucose-lowering drugs 15,109/33,913, and insulin 5,529/12,462 male/female. Male/female ORs of stroke were estimated using a logistic regression model. The age-adjusted ORs of stroke were higher among diabetic men compared with diabetic women with oral glucose-lowering drug treatment (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.22-1.54) and diet treatment only (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.35-1.73). No differences were found among patients who used insulin (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84-1.11). Further adjustment for duration of type 2 diabetes, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and smoking affected the results only slightly. The gender risks of nonfatal stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes appear to differ considerably depending on treatment types.}

The aim of this study was to describe medication use in the management of AF in elderly hospitalized patients with comorbid congestive heart failure (CHF). The hospital records of patients with a diagnosis of AF and CHF were reviewed in a rural Australian medical center. All the patients were hospitalized because of significant systolic ventricular dysfunction. The collected data included age, sex, weight, presenting symptoms of AF, and principle diagnosis on admission; medical history; and history of smoking and alcohol consumption. Electrocardiogram before hospital discharge was also retrieved from patient's medical records and was analyzed by the investigators. Cardiovascular and noncardiovascular drugs administered during the hospital stay and at discharge were also documented. Comparison of antiarrhythmic and anticoagulant drugs was made between patients who had AF while hospitalized and those who had a history of AF but were in sinus rhythm while hospitalized. When patients had ≥2 moderate risk factors (eg, age ≥75 years, hypertension, CHF, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%, diabetes mellitus) or ≥1 high risk factor (eg, previous stroke, transient ischemic attack or embolism, mitral valve stenosis, or prosthetic heart valve), they were defined as being eligible for anticoagulation treatment. One hundred forty patients (74 men, 66 women; mean [SD] age, 77.1 [6.9] years; all were white) had a diagnosis of AF and were selected for the study. Of these, 92 patients (65.7%) (47 women, 45 men; mean [SD] age, 77.4 [9-2] years) had continuous AF and 48 patients (34.3%) (29 men, 19 women; mean [SD] age, 76.3 [12.4] years) had a history of AF but were in sinus rhythm at admission and discharge. The most commonly used antiarrhythmic drug was digoxin, which was prescribed significantly more frequently in the AF group than in the history of AF group (50 (54.3%] vs 14 [29.2%]; P < 0.01). Amiodarone was prescribed significantly less frequently in the continuous AF group than in the group with a history of AF (7 [7.6%] vs 19 [39-6%]; P < 0.01). There was no significant between-group difference in the use of β-blockers (26 [28.3%] vs 19 [39-6%]), verapamil/diltiazem (9 [9-8%] vs 3 [6.3%]), or Sotalol (2 [2.2%] vs 4 [8.3%]). The mean (SD) resting heart rate for the 140 study patients was 91 (27) bpm. The mean resting heart rate for the patients with AF was significantly higher at admission than at discharge (97 [28] vs 79 [19] bpm; P < 0.01). Of the 110 patients who were eligible for anticoagulation treatment, 64 (58.2%) were prescribed warfarin at discharge. Eligible patients not receiving oral warfarin were significantly older than those who did receive warfarin (79-7 [9-0] vs 75.8 [9.0] years; P = 0.02). In these elderly hospitalized Australian patients with AF and CHF, digoxin, β-blockers, and amiodarone were the most commonly used antiarrhythmic drugs. Anticoagulation treatment was prescribed in ~60% of these patients.}

During the first 24 hours hypoglycaemic episodes were noted in 111 (12%) insulin-treated (symptomatic 23%) and three (1.0%) routinely treated patients (symptomatic 33%). Symptomatic hypoglycaemia related to mortality (unadjusted HR 1.99; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.29; p = 0.0074) but this difference disappeared following adjustment (HR 1.09; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.87; p = 0.7403).

Such episodes were, however, more prevalent in patients at high risk for other reasons.}

Home blood pressure and heart rate were measured once every morning for 26 days (median). A total of 462 deaths occurred over a median of 11.9 years, composing 168 cardiovascular deaths (stroke: n=83; cardiac: n=85) and 294 noncardiovascular deaths. Using Cox regression, we computed hazard ratios while adjusting for baseline characteristics, including blood pressure and heart rate level, sex, age, obesity, current smoking and drinking habits, history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and treatment with antihypertensive drugs. An increase in systolic blood pressure variability of +1 between-subject SD was associated with increased hazard ratios for cardiovascular (1.27; P=0.002) and stroke mortality (1.41; P=0.0009) but not for cardiac mortality (1.13; P=0.26). Conversely, heart rate variability was associated with cardiovascular (1.24; P=0.002) and cardiac mortality (1.30; P=0.003) but not stroke mortality (1.17; P=0.12). Similar findings were observed for diastolic blood pressure variability. Additional adjustment of heart rate variability for systolic blood pressure variability and vice versa produced confirmatory results. Coefficient of variation, defined as within-subject SD divided by level of blood pressure or heart rate, displayed similar prognostic value. In conclusion, day-by-day blood pressure variability and heart rate variability by self-measurement at home make up a simple method of providing useful clinical information for assessing cardiovascular risk.}

Compared to European hypertensive women, African hypertensive women had a higher body-mass index (28.8 vs 26.3 kg/m2, p<0.001) and were more often diabetic (12 vs 5%, p<0.001). Hypertensive men and women born in sub-Saharan Africa had higher systolic blood pressure (152 vs 148 mmHg, p<0.001), were more likely to have a history of stroke (11.7 vs 6.7%, p<0.001) and were less likely to have a history of smoking or hyperlipidemia than European controls. Sub-Saharan Africans were more frequently given antihypertensive medication than their paired controls (84 vs 74%, p<0.001), and their antihypertensive regimens were more likely to include a diuretic (54 vs 46%, p=0.001) or a calcium channel antagonist (58 vs 49%, p=0.001). Compared to European controls, patients born in sub-Saharan Africa had more frequent proteinuria (test strip positivity : 32 vs 18%, p<0.001), irrespective of blood pressure and diabetes. The overall prevalence of secondary hypertension was similar in the two populations. However, patients born in sub-Saharan Africa were more likely than their European controls to have primary hyperaldosteronism (12 vs 7%, p=0.001) and less likely to have renovascular disease (1 vs 5%, p=0.001). Thus, the higher prevalence of cardiovascular and renal complications at referral among patients born in sub-Saharan Africa relative to age- and sex-matched European patients does not seem to be explained solely by observed differences in blood pressure or associated risk factors. The difference in the distribution of secondary hypertension warrants further study.}

  abstract = {A community-based study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in Japanese adults aged >or=40 years in Kurashiki-city and to examine associated risk factors. Adult residents (>or=40-year-old) were examined in the Kurashiki-city Annual Medical Survey (KAMS) provided by the Kurashiki-city Public Health Center from May to December 2006. KAMS consisted of medical interviews, physical examination, blood testing and electrocardiography to assess the presence of AF. All participants were divided into AF and non-AF groups, their clinical characteristics compared, and the risk factors associated with AF investigated. Of 246,246 adult residents, 41,436 (age: 72.1+/-11.3 years; 13,963 men) underwent the KAMS. Estimated overall prevalence of AF was 1.6%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that AF was independently associated with cardiac disease (odds ratio (OR), 9.00; 95% confidence interval (CI), 7.65-10.6; p<0.001), chronic kidney disease (OR, 1.76; 95%CI, 1.49-2.07; p<0.001), male sex (OR, 1.59; 95%CI, 1.34-1.85; p<0.001), and diabetes mellitus (OR, 1.46; 95%CI, 1.20-1.78; p<0.001). Hypercholesterolemia was highly associated with the absence of AF (OR, 0.54; 95%CI, 0.45-0.64, p<0.001). Prevalence of AF in Japan is approximately 1.6%, lower than that in Western populations. Male sex, and cardiac and chronic kidney diseases are associated with the presence of AF.}

  abstract = {Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in men as well as in women. Women have their first cardiac event 6 to 10 years later than men do. Whereas, the cardiovascular death rates are declining in men, they remain constant in women. In cardiovascular studies with age limits, women are naturally the minority, amounting to < 40%. Determine the effect of gender on treatment and clinical outcomes in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. This is a multicenter study including 13 government and 4 private institutions. Between August 1, 2002 and October 31, 2005, 3,836 consecutive patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction were enrolled. The patient characteristics, treatment, and hospital outcome were collected and validated. In-hospital management and outcomes were compared between men and women, without adjustment, with adjustment for age alone and with adjustment for age and other covariates by means of multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis. In each model tested, gender was forced into the model, whereas other predictors were selected in a stepwise manner Women were 1,223 patients (31.9%) of all patients and were 8 years older than men (67.5 +/- 12.0 vs. 59.7 +/- 12.4 years). Women had a higher incidence of diabetes and hypertension (46.9% vs. 31.0%, p < 0.001 and 62.1% vs. 45.3%, p < 0.001). Smoking and family risk factor were found in men more than in women (17.5% vs. 52.5%, p < 0.001 and 7.4% vs. 11.2%, p< 0.001). Women presented more frequently with cardiac dyspnea and shock than men (35.3% vs. 22.2%, p < 0.001 and 21.5% vs. 13.8%, p < 0.001). There was no difference in time to admission between men and women. Beta blocker, statin, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor inhibitor (ARB) were less frequently used in women. Coronary angiogram was performed less often in women and less abnormal angiogram were found (57.8% vs. 65.0%, p < 0.001 and 55.5% vs. 63.9%, p < 0.001). A lower percentage of women received thrombolytic therapy (28.1% vs. 31.4%, p = 0.039) as well as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (39.0% vs. 48.5%, p < 0.001).Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in women than in men (23.6% vs. 13.9%, unadjusted OR (95% CI) 1.90 (1.60-2.26), p < 0.001). After adjustment of other covariables (age group> 75 years, hospital group (metropolitan, regional), chest pain, cardiac dyspnea, shock, post cardiac arrest, diabetes, hypertension, family history, smoking, dyslipidemia, refer time to admission < or = 12 hours (hour), aspirin, beta blocker calcium antagonist, statin, ACEI, ARB, nitrate, coronary angiogram, thrombolysis, PCI, coronary artery bypass grafting, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, stroke, bleeding), the gender difference in-hospital mortality no longer existed (adjusted OR (95% CI) 1.03 (0.80-1.33), p = 0.814). The incidence of congestive heart failure as a complication was significantly higher in women than in men (55.6% vs. 38.7%, p < 0.001, adjusted OR (95% CI) 1.29 (1.08-1.54), p = 0.005). Women with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction were older and had a higher incidence of hypertension and diabetes than men. Women were less likely than men to undergo coronary angioplasty. Women in the authors' registry had a higher risk for in-hospital morbidity and mortality than men. Early and aggressive treatment might improve the clinical outcomes in women with STEMI.}

  abstract = {The risk of stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF) needs to be assessed in each patient to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of thromboprophylaxis, with the aim of appropriate use of antithrombotic therapy. To achieve this, stroke risk factors in AF populations need to be identified and stroke risk stratification models have been devised on the basis of these risk factors. In this article, we firstly provide a systematic review of studies examining the attributable stroke risk of various clinical, demographic and echocardiographic patient characteristics in AF populations. Secondly, we performed a systematic review of published stroke risk stratification models, in terms of the results of the review of stroke risk factors and their ability to accurately discriminate between different levels of stroke risk. Thirdly, we review the health economic evidence relating to the cost-effectiveness of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy as thromboprophylaxis in AF patients. The studies included in the systematic review of stroke risk factors identified history of stroke or TIA, increasing age, hypertension and structural heart disease (left-ventricular dysfunction or hypertrophy) to be good predictors of stroke risk in AF patients. The evidence regarding diabetes mellitus, gender and other patient characteristics was less consistent. Three stroke risk stratification models were identified that were able to discriminate between different categories of stroke risk to at least 95% accuracy. Few models had addressed the cumulative nature of risk factors where a combination of risk factors would confer a greater risk than either factor alone. In patients at high risk of stroke, anticoagulation is cost effective, but not for those with a low risk of stroke. With the evidence available for stroke risk factors and the various alternative stroke risk stratification models, a review of these models in terms of the evidence on which they are devised and their performance in representative AF populations is important. The appropriate administration of thromboprophylaxis in AF patients would need to balance the risks and benefits of antithrombotic therapy with its cost-effectiveness.}

  abstract = {Sleep apnea occurs frequently among patients with stroke, but it is still unknown whether a diagnosis of sleep apnea is an independent risk factor for mortality. We aimed to investigate whether obstructive or central sleep apnea was related to reduced long-term survival among patients with stroke. Of 151 patients admitted for in-hospital stroke rehabilitation in the catchment area of Umeå from April 1, 1995, to May 1, 1997, 132 underwent overnight sleep apnea recordings at a mean (SD) of 23 (8) days after the onset of stroke. All patients were followed up prospectively for a mean (SD) of 10.0 (0.6) years, with death as the primary outcome; no one was lost to follow-up. Obstructive sleep apnea was defined when the obstructive apnea-hypopnea index was 15 or greater, and central sleep apnea was defined when the central apnea-hypopnea index was 15 or greater. Patients with obstructive and central apnea-hypopnea indexes of less than 15 served as control subjects. Of 132 enrolled patients, 116 had died at follow-up. The risk of death was higher among the 23 patients with obstructive sleep apnea than controls (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.95; P = .03), independent of age, sex, body mass index, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and Barthel index of activities of daily living. There was no difference in mortality between the 28 patients with central sleep apnea and controls (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.76; P = .80). Patients with stroke and obstructive sleep apnea have an increased risk of early death. Central sleep apnea was not related to early death among the present patients.}

  abstract = {We examined the influence of gender on the prevalence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and the severity of depressive symptoms post-ACS. Patients received a Zung self-assessment questionnaire at hospital discharge for unstable angina (UA) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and returned it by mail. Major depressive symptoms were diagnosed based on a summed depressive symptoms (SDS) score of >50. Depressive symptomatology was modeled by stepwise multivariable logistic regression with the following predictors: gender, age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, history of smoking, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular disease, prior stroke, prior myocardial infarction (MI), and prior percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery. We also modeled severity of depressive symptoms via stepwise multiple linear regression with the same predictor variables. A total of 944 patients were surveyed: 716 men and 228 women, mean (SD) age, 67 (13) years and 71 (12) years, respectively. Of these patients, 250 (35%) men and 103 (45%) women had depressive symptoms (P = 0.005). No significant difference was observed between men and women in rates of cardiac catheterization; severity of coronary artery disease; treatment with antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or statins; or percutaneous or surgical revascularization rates during or post-ACS. Significant predictors of the presence of depressive symptoms were female gender (odds ratio [OR] = 1.64; 95% CI, 1.19-1.28), diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.03-1.97), prior MI (OR = 1.56; 95% CI, 1.15-2.20), and smoking (OR = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.01-1.97). Variables significantly associated with a higher severity of depressive symptoms were female gender, prior MI, smoking, and stroke. Men with prior MI had significantly higher mean (SD) SDS scores than did men without prior MI in all age groups (48.4 [11] vs 44.6 [11], respectively; P < 0.001). In addition, significantly more men with prior MI had depressive symptoms compared with those without prior MI (45% vs 32%; P = 0.001). However, prior MI did not appear to affect SDS scores in women (49.1 [12] for prior MI vs 48.5 [12] for no prior MI; P = NS), and there was no significant difference in the percentage of women who had depressive symptoms with or without a history of prior MI. Depressive symptoms were much more severe in women with UA (SDS = 49.0 [12]) compared with women with AMI (SDS = 45.0 [12]; P = NS), or men with AMI (45.0 [12]; P = 0.004) or UA (46.0 [11]; P = 0.007) (analysis of variance, P = 0.003). Female gender is a significant independent predictor of depressive symptoms and their severity post-UA and post-AMI. History of prior MI is associated with a higher frequency and severity of depressive symptoms in men. These findings call for routine screening for depressive symptoms in men with prior MI and in women who present with ACS.}

The purpose of the study was to determine, during six months, on four examinations (the first, and three follow-ups after the second, fourth and sixth month), the following: physical activity (PA) alteration and the number of cigarettes smoked; the effect of antihypertensive beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors on systolic and diastolic arterial tension; the effect of metmorfin therapy on BMI, glycaemia, total cholesterol level (TCL) and triglycerides in diabetics compared to healthy individuals; the effect of hypolipidaemics on blood TCL and triglycerides in patients with angina pectoris (AP); the effect of betablocker therapy on TCL. This was a multicentric interventional study. Secondary prevention of coronary disease and cerebrovascular conditions was applied in the first half of 2005. There were 185 general practitioners from 38 health centres in Serbia, and patients of both sexes were included with the verified diagnosis of coronary disease and/or cerebrovascular condition. They had demographic data verified as well as data of being genetically (non)predisposed for AP, hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke and diabetes mellitus. Descriptive and differential statistical methods were used for study result analysis. Out of 1189 patients, there were 51.4% of women and 48.6% of men. The average age was 59.45 +/- 9.77 years. The population was homogeneous by sex and the factor of being genetically (non)predisposed for AP. There was a significant difference in examinations in four contacts in PA and cigarette smoking (p < 0.0001). Systolic and diastolic pressure, TCL and triglycerides were significantly decreased by medicaments (p < 0.05) and more significantly so associated with nonmedicamentous measures (p < 0.001). Metmorfin significantly decreased the glycaemic level (p < 0.001) both in diabetics and patients with a reduced tolerance level to glucose. In patients who took betablockers, there was lowering of TCL. Taking medicaments significantly lowers RF, and more significantly so when associated with a non-medicamentous therapy.}

The coronary risk score was derived from a Weibull function using data from 18 460 men and 8515 women who were recruited before 1996 and had a mean follow-up period of 12+/-6 years. The stroke score was derived using a Cox proportional hazards model using data of 5905 men and 2225 women aged 35-65 years with at least 10 years of unbroken follow-up. The coronary risk score was based on 511 major coronary events, 462 (168 fatal, 294 non-fatal) in men and 49 (18 fatal, 31 non-fatal) in women and included the risk factors LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, triglycerides and diabetes mellitus status. It was accurate in both sexes over an age range from 20 to 75 years with an area under the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve of 0.82. The stroke score was based on 85 cerebral ischaemic events (21 TIAs, 64 ischaemic strokes) and included the risk factors age, sex, diabetes mellitus status, smoking status and systolic blood pressure. It had an area under the ROC curve of 0.78 and identified a high-risk group comprising only 4% of the study population that contained 31% of all cerebral ischaemic events. Both new PROCAM risk scores provide simple and effective ways to assess the risk of acute coronary events and ischaemic stroke in the general population and will improve the ability of physicians to target measures in an effort to prevent these potentially devastating conditions.}

Stroke severity was measured using the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (0-58); computed tomography determined stroke type. A risk factor profile was obtained for all including ischemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, previous stroke, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Date of death was obtained within a 10-year follow-up period. Predictors of death were identified using a Cox proportional hazards model. Of 999 patients, 559 (56%) were women and 440 (44%) were men. Women were older (77.0 v 70.9 years; P < .001) and had more severe strokes (Scandinavian Stroke Scale: 36.1 v 40.5; P < .001). Age-adjusted risk factors showed no difference between sexes for ischemic heart disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke. Men more often were smokers and alcohol consumers. Unadjusted survival in men and women did not differ: 70.3% versus 66.7% (1-year), 40.0% versus 38.9% (5-year), and 17.4% versus 18.7% (10-year), respectively. Adjusting for age, stroke severity, stroke type, and risk factors, women had a higher probability of survival at 1 year (hazard ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.10-2.00); 5 years (hazard ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.23-1.76); and 10 years (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.28-1.76). Before 9 months poststroke, no difference in survival was seen. Severity of stroke had the same effect on sex. Stroke is equally severe in men and women. Short-term survival is the same.

Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine concentration > or =1.5 mg/dl) and other characteristics (age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, history of stroke, previous MI, hemodialysis, and atrial fibrillation) were compared between patients who had MI with painful symptoms (painful MI, n=131) and patients who had MI without painful symptoms (painless MI, n=18). Other variables compared were the time from symptom onset to admission, peak creatine kinase concentration, Killip class, site of MI, emergency coronary angiography, postprocedural Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction grade III flow, and in-hospital death. Univariate analysis identified older age, renal insufficiency, and previous MI as predictors of painless MI. Patients with painless MI showed higher rates of Killip class > or =II and in-hospital death and a longer time from symptom onset to admission. However, multivariate analysis identified only renal insufficiency as an independent predictor of painless MI. MI without painful symptoms frequently develops in patients who have renal insufficiency, so the possibility of painless MI should be evaluated in such patients to ensure early diagnosis and treatment.}

The prevalence of stroke in the patients studied was 3.5%. Most of the patients were type 2 diabetes and had ischemic stroke. One of the risk factors associated with stroke was age greater than 60 years, and the risk appeared to be highest if the patients' age was greater than 70 years (adjust OR = 3.29, p = 0.012). Other risk factors included male sex, systolic blood pressure of > or =140 mmHg, use of oral hypoglycemic agents, lipid lowering agents and aspirin. There was no association between stroke and duration of diabetes, occupation, educational level, BMI, smoking, alcohol drinking, diastolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive drugs or insulin, glycemic control, lipid profiles and kidney function. Ischemic stroke was common among Thai patients with diabetes especially in the elderly. The present result emphasizes the relationship between level of systolic blood pressure and the occurrence of stroke. Optimal blood pressure control should be underscored in caring for diabetic patients.}

After adjustment for diabetes mellitus, the difference became insignificant, although a 70% greater risk of 1-year mortality was still observed. Compared with whites and men, African American women have a lower 1-year survival following ischemic stroke.}

  abstract = {Risk estimates for stroke in patients with diabetes vary. We sought to obtain reliable risk estimates for stroke and the association with diabetes, comorbidity and lifestyle in a large cohort of type 2 diabetic patients in the UK. Using the General Practice Research Database, we identified all patients who had type 2 diabetes and were aged 35 to 89 years on 1 January 1992. We also identified five comparison subjects without diabetes and of the same age and sex. Hazard ratios (HRs) for stroke between January 1992 and October 1999 were calculated, and the association with age, sex, body mass index, smoking, hypertension, atrial fibrillation and duration of diabetes was investigated. The absolute rate of stroke was 11.91 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 11.41-12.43) in people with diabetes (n = 41,799) and 5.55 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 5.40-5.70) in the comparison group (n = 202,733). The age-adjusted HR for stroke in type 2 diabetic compared with non-diabetic subjects was 2.19 (95% CI 2.09-2.32) overall, 2.08 (95% CI 1.94-2.24) in men and 2.32 (95% CI 2.16-2.49) in women. The increase in risk attributable to diabetes was highest among young women (HR 8.18; 95% CI 4.31-15.51) and decreased with age. No investigated comorbidity or lifestyle characteristic emerged as a major contributor to risk of stroke. This study provides risk estimates for stroke for an unselected population from UK general practice. Patients with type 2 diabetes were at an increased risk of stroke, which decreased with age and was higher in women. Additional risk factors for stroke in type 2 diabetic patients included duration of diabetes, smoking, obesity, atrial fibrillation and hypertension.}

  abstract = {In the present case-control study we aimed to investigate the association of common carotid arterial (CCA) stiffness with ischaemic stroke (IS) and to determine whether this relationship was independent of conventional risk factors including CCA intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT). CCA distensibility, defined as the change of CCA-diameter during the cardiac cycle, and CCA-IMT were evaluated by means of high-resolution B-mode carotid ultrasound examination in consecutive, first-ever IS patients (n=193) and in age- and sex-matched control subjects (n=106). The CCA distensibility (inverse of CCA stiffness) was significantly (P=0.007) lower in IS (0.353 mm, 95% CI: 0.326-0.379) than in control subjects (0.415 mm, 95% CI: 0.378-0.451) even after adjusting for blood pressure values, diastolic CCA-diameter and height. The multivariate logistic regression procedure selected CCA-IMT and CCA distensibility as the only independent predictor variables of IS. Each 1 SD increase in the CCA-IMT and each 1 SD decrease in the CCA distensibility independently increased the likelihood of IS by 167.0% (OR: 2.67, 95% CI: 1.80-3.96, P<0.001) and 59.0% (OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.22-2.07, P=0.001) respectively. Increased CCA stiffness is associated with IS independent of conventional risk factors and CCA-IMT. The causal interrelationship between the elastic properties of the CCA and the risk of stroke deserves further investigation by longitudinal studies.}

Few data exist correlating cardiovascular risk factors with volumetric measurements of coronary atheroma burden in patients with coronary artery disease. Clinical characteristics, quantitative coronary angiography, and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) were evaluated in subjects enrolled in a study comparing atorvastatin and pravastatin. Plaque areas were measured at 1-mm intervals to compute atheroma volume. The percent of cross sections with an abnormal intimal thickness (>0.5 mm) was determined. Data on cardiovascular risk factors were collected. In 654 subjects, atheroma volume averaged 174.5 mm3 and percent atheroma volume 38.9%. Atherosclerosis was present in 81.2% of 25,897 cross sections. In univariate analysis, there was a strong association between diabetes, male gender, and a history of either prior revascularization or stroke with percent atheroma volume. Hypertension or prior myocardial infarction was also predictive of more severe disease. Low-density lipoprotein and C-reactive protein were not significant predictors of greater disease burden. In multivariate analysis, diabetes, male gender, and a history of a prior interventional procedure remained strong predictors of increased atheroma volume. History of stroke, non-Caucasian race, and smoking status remained significant. Although multiple measures of IVUS disease burden were worse in subjects with diabetes, angiographic stenosis severity was not different. Male gender, diabetes, and a history of prior revascularization are strong independent predictors of atherosclerotic burden in coronary disease patients. Many risk factors did not predict angiographic disease severity, suggesting different mechanisms drive stenosis development and atheroma accumulation.}

In a 14-year follow-up study, causes of death were ascertained among 10,546 Japanese aged 30 years or older at the baseline. The proportion of the excess male risk of CVD explained by the differences in risk factors was estimated as (HR0-HR1)/(HR0-1), where HR0 is the age-adjusted hazard ratio (men vs women) and HR1 is the age and risk factor-adjusted hazard ratio. The age-adjusted male:female ratios were 1.60 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.32-1.94) for CVD, 1.75 (95% CI, 1.33-2.30) for stroke, and 1.55 (95% CI, 0.97-2.49) for coronary heart disease. The proportion of excess male risk of CVD explained by smoking was 46% and excess risk explained by all risk factors including smoking was 36%. In men, drinking habits decreased the excess risk of CVD. Except for the association between drinking habits and CVD, the impact of the hazard ratios of conventional risk factors had no sex difference. Smoking contributes substantially to excess male mortality from CVD when the smoking rates vary substantially by sex.}

We used transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography tests as parameters of intracranial vascular disease and investigated the relationship between these parameters and conventional cardiovascular risk factors. We prospectively studied 598 patients with a minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). In all patients, flow velocities in the left and right middle cerebral artery (MCA), and cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2 were measured by means of TCD sonography. Student's t-test and linear regression analysis were used to determine the relationship between the baseline characteristics, vascular risk factors, and TCD parameters. After adjustment for other vascular risk factors, a statistically significant relationship with mean flow velocity in the MCA was found for age (3.5 cm/s/10 years of age; 95% CI, 2.5-4.5 cm/s/10 years of age; p < 0.0001), sex (-2.9 cm/s for male sex; 95% CI, -5.5 to -0.3 cm/s; p = 0.03), diabetes (5.6 cm/s for diabetics; 95% CI, 2.1-9.1 cm/s; p = 0.002), and total serum cholesterol (2.4 cm/s per mmol increase in total serum cholesterol; 95% CI, 1.4-3.5 cm/s; p < 0.0001). Total serum cholesterol and hypertension were related to cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2. Cerebral flow velocity is influenced by multiple interacting factors. Results of TCD investigations should be adjusted for age, sex, diabetes, and cholesterol when used for diagnostic or prognostic purposes.}

Population-based case-control study of a basic health zone (12,200 inhabitants). We included 91 patients, diagnosed with the first episode of cerebrovascular disease (1999-2003), and 182 controls (2 per case), paired by age and sex in the same time period. The estimation of the incidence of cerebrovascular disease in our series is between 160 and 190 cases/100,000 inhabitants and year. The prevalence of arterial hypertension in the cerebrovascular disease group is 75%; 25% have previously suffered a transient ischemic attack and 31% had atrial fibrillation. Other vascular risk factors such as diabetes or hyperlipidaemia are present in 33% and 38%, respectively. Other risk factors are smoking (25%), ischemic cardiopathy (14%) and family antecedents of cerebrovascular disease (21.3%). An association has been found between cerebrovascular disease and arterial hypertension (OR=2.2; 95% CI = 1.2-4.0), personal antecedent of transient ischemic attack (OR=4.0; 95% CI 1.9-8.5), atrial fibrillation (OR=2.8; 95% CI 1.4-5.3), diabetes mellitus (OR=2.5; 95% CI 1.3-4-6). The results obtained on a population basis - not only a hospital basis - will help us to obtain a more precise understanding of the aetiopathogeny of cerebrovascular disease. The results observed for arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidaemia, since they are modifiable risk factors; underline the importance of primary prevention. Similarly, such measures should be strengthened in the subjects with atrial fibrillation. The association with prior diagnosis of transient ischemic attack strengthens the need for adjusting the secondary prevention measures in this group of patients.}

A consecutive series of 246 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery were reviewed. The severity of CAS was estimated as a CAS score based on coronary angiography. The presence of ECAS and ICAS was screened by transcranial Doppler and carotid duplex sonography, and confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography. The CAS scores in patients with ECAS were observed to be higher than those in patients without ECAS (10.62+/- 4.80 vs. 9.45+/- 4.25; p=0.054 on the Mann-Whitney U test). The difference in CAS scores was smaller between patients with and without ICAS (10.41+/- 4.44 vs. 9.66+/- 4.49; p=0.201). Similar patterns were observed on comparing the correlation of ECAS and ICAS with a quartile of the CAS score. An advanced CAS, which was generated by collapsing the quartiles of the CAS score into 75th percentile or less and more than the 75th percentile, was significantly associated with ECAS, but not with ICAS. These associations remained unchanged after adjustments had been made for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking and a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. This study suggests that the correlation of CAS with ECAS is stronger than that of CAS with ICAS, and this difference is independent of the classic risk factors for atherosclerosis.}

Congestive heart failure (odds ratio [OR]=3.62), chronic renal disease (OR=2.54), female sex (OR=2.27), previous cerebrovascular disease (OR=1.71), and atrial fibrillation (OR=1.38) were significantly associated with ischemic stroke, whereas diabetes (OR=0.68), hypertension (OR=0.61), hyperlipidemia (OR=0.45), and heavy smoking (OR=0.21) occurred more frequently in patients under 85 years. Adequate treatment of potentially modifiable risk factors, including congestive heart failure, chronic renal disease, and atrial fibrillation may contribute to prevent ischemic stroke in very old people.}

Adiponectin has been identified as one of the adipocytokines, and hypoadiponectinemia was demonstrated in patients with obesity, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Whether decreased adiponectin levels are cause or consequence is an important issue in the discussion on the association between adiponectin and atherosclerosis. In the present study, we investigated the association of plasma adiponectin levels with sonographic phenotypes of subclinical atherosclerosis, which may represent different stages of disease as well as common and distinct determinants. A total of 1515 middle-aged healthy white subjects (940 males and 575 females) were included. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) and presence of atherosclerotic plaques were assessed by B-mode ultrasound. After adjustment for established risk factors, per 1 microg/mL decrease in adiponectin CIMT increased on the average by 3.48 microm in males (95% CI, 1.23 to 5.73 microm) and by 2.39 microm in females (95% CI, 0.50 to 4.27 microm). After dichotomizing adiponectin levels at the median and adjustment for established risk factors, the mean difference of CIMT between subjects with low and high adiponectin levels was 20.42 microm in men (95% CI, 6.80 to 34.04; P=0.003) and 20.75 microm in women (95% CI, 1.08 to 40.42; P=0.039). No significant relationship was found between adiponectin levels and presence of atherosclerotic plaques. Our results demonstrate an independent negative association of adiponectin levels and CIMT, whereas no relationship with presence of atherosclerotic plaques was found, thus suggesting hypoadiponectinemia as a risk factor in the development of early atherosclerosis.}

Variables examined included LTPA measured as kilocalories of energy expended per week, contextual variables (age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), acculturation/structural assimilation), psychosocial measures (self-esteem, mastery, perceived health control), lifestyle variables (fat avoidance, current alcohol drinker, years smoking, body mass index (BMI)), and presence of chronic diseases (diabetes mellitus, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension, arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, mild cognitive impairment). Hierarchical multiple regression was used to examine potential mediators of the ethnic group-LTPA association. EAs expended almost 300 kcal/wk more energy than did MAs (1,287 kcal/wk vs 1,001 kcal/wk). SES and psychosocial (self-esteem), lifestyle (fat avoidance, smoking, BMI), and disease (depression) factors that vary by SES explained this ethnic difference. In MAs, structural assimilation, but not acculturation, was significantly associated with LTPA independent of SES. Self-esteem, BMI, and depression explained this association. Psychosocial resources, lifestyle behaviors, and depression explain differences in LTPA between older MAs and EAs. Interventions to increase LTPA in both ethnic groups should be targeted especially at women and persons who have low self-esteem, smoke, and are obese or depressed. In MAs, additional emphasis should be focused on those who are less structurally assimilated into the broader American society.}

Age, hypertensive status, smoking status, coronary artery disease, orthostatic hypotension, diabetes mellitus, and symptomatic cerebrovascular disease (stroke or transient ischemic attack) were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson chi(2) testing and binary logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and orthostatic hypotension was similar among groups. The PD group had more patients who never smoked and less current smokers than the other groups. While there were similar frequencies of symptomatic cerebrovascular disease among groups, the prevalence of stroke was lower in PD patients. This difference disappeared upon stratification into groups based on smoking status and in the addition of smoking as a covariate in the multivariate analysis. Diminished smoking in PD patients likely plays a role in our finding of decreased stroke in patients with PD. Increased access to appropriate neurological care and subsequent prevention of stroke after a warning transient ischemic attack may also play a role, as may diminished levels of excitotoxic neurotransmitters in PD patients.}

Several studies have shown the relationship between carotid plaque morphology and cerebrovascular disorders. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the structure of carotid plaque and correlate carotid plague morphology with neurological symptoms, stroke risk factors, severity of carotid stenosis and operative stroke. Operative specimens of 262 carotid plaques were examined macroscopically. Plague morphology was characterized as either heterogeneous or homogeneous. Stroke risk factors, cerebrovascular symptoms, severity of carotid stenosis and risk for mortality and operative stroke were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with heterogeneous and homogeneous plague. Heterogeneous plaques were present in 198 (75%) of 262 arteries. Heterogeneous plaques were found in 121 symptomatic and 77 asymptomatic patients (p<0.001). Homogeneous plagues did not differ in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The structure of plaque did not correlate with any severity of stenosis. There were no significant differences in age, sex, smoking and arterial hypertension between heterogeneous and homogeneous groups. Higher level of fibrinogen but not hypercholesterolemia was associated with heterogeneity of plaque. Postoperative stroke was mainly present in the patients with heterogeneous plaques, but the difference was not statistically significant. Heterogeneous plaques were present in 75 % of patients with carotid artery stenosis. Heterogeneous plagues were associated with cerebrovascular symptoms more often than homogeneous ones. Plague structure did not correlate with severity of carotid artery stenosis and operative stroke was not associated with plaque heterogeneity. These findings suggest that plague heterogeneity should be considered in selecting patients for carotid endarterectomy.}

Study cohorts included 51,735 Finnish men and women aged 25-74 years. Smoking status and the history of MI and type 2 diabetes were recorded, and height, weight, blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels were measured at baseline. Additional data on the occurrence of diabetes and MI prior to baseline survey were obtained from national hospital discharge and drug registers through computerised register linkage. Mortality data were obtained from the national mortality register. During a mean follow-up period of 17.2 years, 9,201 deaths were recorded. Hazard ratios (HRs) for coronary mortality were 2.1, 4.0 and 6.4 among men with diabetes alone, men with MI alone, and men with diabetes and MI, respectively, compared with men with neither diabetes nor a history of MI. The corresponding HRs among women were 4.9, 2.5 and 9.4, respectively. The equivalent HRs for cardiovascular and total mortality were 2.2, 3.3 and 6.0, and 1.8, 2.3 and 3.7 in men, and 4.4, 2.4 and 6.5, and 3.2, 1.7 and 4.4 in women, respectively. Diabetic men and women had similar total mortality rates, whereas total mortality rates were markedly higher among men in the other three diabetes-MI categories. Diabetes and MI markedly increase cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. In women, the association between diabetes and mortality was stronger than that between MI and mortality, whereas the converse was true among men.}

  abstract = {A lacunar infarct is defined as the occlusion of a single perforating artery. Certain researchers have proposed that patients with lacunar infarcts can be classified into two clinically distinct entities: patients with a single, symptomatic lacunar infarct, and patients with multiple lacunar infarcts together with hypertension and leukoaraiosis. The present study attempted to delineate the characteristics of lacunar infarcts and evaluate the validity of the aforementioned hypothesis. A total of 130 consecutive patients with first-time symptomatic lacunar infarct were studied. All patients were dichotomized into two groups according to two different kinds of models as follows. Model-1: patients with a single lacune and patients with multiple lacunes; and Model-2: patients with large lacune and patients with small lacune. Associated factors for the multiple lacune group compared with the single lacune group as well as the large lacune group compared with the small lacune group, were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Associated factors included age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, smoking, extracranial and intra-cranial vascular lesions, extent of lacunes and white matter lesions, progression status and blood pressure in the acute stage, and coagulation markers such as fibrinogen, thrombin-antithrombin complex, D-dimer, beta-thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4. Results for Model-1: hypertension (age-and sex-adjusted OR: 2.58, p = 0.017) and elevated systolic blood pressure (>160mmHg for the mean value during the first post-ictal week; OR: 2.55, p = 0.016) were significantly associated with the multiple lacune group. Large lacunes (>10mm in diameter) were negatively associated with the multiple lacune group (OR: 0.38, p = 0.017). Association between confluent white matter lesions and the multiple lacune group approached significance (OR: 2.16, p = 0.056). Results for Model-2: female sex (OR: 0.39, p = 0.021), mild stenosis of intracranial and extracranial arteries (<25%) (intracranial; OR: 5.42, p = 0.0042, extracranial; OR: 3.30, p = 0.016), progressing stroke (OR: 6.77, p<0.0001), and high levels of TAT (>3ng/ml) (OR: 2.80, p = 0.039) were significantly associated with the large lacune group. Multiple lacunes (OR: 0.38, p = 0.016) and confluent white matter lesions (OR: 0.28, p = 0.007) exhibited a significant negative association with the large lacune group. In conclusion, underlying vasculopathy in the presence of multiple lacunes may correspond to lipohyalinosis resulting from hypertension. Moreover, large lacune may correspond to microatheroma at the orifice of penetrating arteries.}

For obesity evaluation and classification, we used the body mass index (BMI) and the World Health Organization (WHO) and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) criteria. The cardiovascular risk factors investigated were sex, age, systemic hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes mellitus (DM) and smoking. For cardiovascular morbidities, we considered acute myocardial infarction, intermittent claudication and stroke. Waist-hip ratio (W/H), regular consumption of alcoholic beverages and physical activity were investigated too. The obesity prevalence was 23.3% according to WHO (without difference between sex, p=0.124) and 45.6% according to NHANES III criteria (significantly higher in female, p=0.05). Obesity associations with risk factors were sex-dependent (the obese females presented higher levels of systolic blood pressure and glucose, lower levels of HDL-c, and higher systemic hypertension and DM frequencies; while the obese males presented higher levels of diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL-c and higher hypercholesterolemia frequency). W/H and triglycerides, as well as hypertriglyceridemia frequency, were higher in obese people. The obesity prevalence was high among the long-living elderly, and its association with cardiovascular risk factors was sex-dependent. As regards morbidities, we did not observe differences between obese and non-obese people.}

A total of 1710 randomly enrolled participants between the ages of 45 and 75 with no history of myocardial infarction or stroke received a clinical periodontal examination, carotid scan using high-resolution B-mode ultrasound, and extensive measurements for conventional cardiovascular risk factors (age, education, smoking, alcohol, body mass index, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and triglycerides) as well as markers of healthy lifestyle and social network. In both genders, measures of current and long-term periodontitis worsened as tooth loss increased. In males but not females, an approximately 10% difference in carotid artery plaque prevalence was observed between the lowest and highest tertiles of tooth loss (P<0.05) and long-term periodontitis (P=0.05) after multivariate adjustment. Similar patterns were observed for intima-media thickness. The influence of gender on carotid artery plaque prevalence was most evident among the younger age group (<59 years). Between genders, carotid plaque prevalence differed by 10%, 15%, and 25% across increasing levels of tooth loss, and by 5%, 15%, and 25% across increasing levels of long-term periodontitis. Our data suggest that tooth loss and long-term periodontitis are related to subclinical atherosclerosis in men but not women. Gender variations in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality may be explained partly by the differential contributions of novel risk factors across genders.}

Lower SaO(2) was independent of potential confounders associated with more severe periventricular white matter lesions (score increased by 0.12 per 1% decrease in SaO(2) (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.23)). Participants with COPD had more severe periventricular white matter lesions than those without (adjusted mean difference in score 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.23 to 1.16)). Lower SaO(2) and COPD were not associated with subcortical white matter lesions or lacunar infarcts. Lower SaO(2) and COPD are associated with more severe periventricular white matter lesions.}

Three hundred seventy-two patients with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke were included to evaluate the relation between blood pressure course and early neurologic outcome. The following data were collected: age; sex; history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke; smoking habits; preadmission blood pressure, blood pressure on admission, and blood pressure 24 hours later; antihypertensive treatment; and stroke localization. We assessed outcome at day 5 after admission as dependent or independent (Rankin Scale score <or=2) and applied multivariate logistic regression analysis to investigate the effect of blood pressure changes on outcome, with adjustment for other baseline variables. Relative changes of systolic and diastolic blood pressure within hospital admission to 24 hours after admission revealed significant differences of patients' neurologic outcome only for diastolic blood pressure changes from admission to 24 hours. A diastolic blood pressure decrease more than 25% from admission until 24 hours after admission was associated with a 3.8-fold increased adjusted odds (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 12.1) for poor neurologic outcome on day 5 (Rankin Scale score 3 to 5). Excessive diastolic blood pressure reduction was associated with an increased risk for an impaired neurologic outcome in patients with ischemic stroke. The association between both characteristics was independent from concomitant risk factors, stroke localization, and possible antihypertensive treatment.}

With special reference to gender, education, and obesity, it is hypothesized that changes in health among elderly men and women may not be occurring in a uniform manner. The variables studied were: systolic and diastolic blood pressures, triglycerides, cholesterol, height, weight, body mass index, waist-hip ratio, physical inactivity, current smoking, and alcohol consumption, plus selected prevalent diseases. Logistic and linear regression models were used to test for secular trends and effect modification by gender. Most trends in metabolic and lifestyle indicators varied in relation to gender as well as education. For instance, later-born male cohorts were more overweight than earlier-born groups while the later-born female cohorts had similar relative weights but a more centralized fat patterning. These cohort differences further varied by education where later-born men with less education and later-born women with higher education tended to be more overweight, compared to earlier-born cohorts. Finally, significant cohort differences in previously diagnosed myocardial infarction, stroke, and diabetes mellitus at age 70 were observed in men only. Interaction terms revealed that the gender difference was statistically significant only in the case of diabetes mellitus. In conclusion, secular trends in many obesity-related health indicators among 70-year old Swedish cohorts were dependent on both gender and socio-economic factors.}

Differences between patients who received and patients who did not receive LLDs, as well as patients who received different classes of LLDs were compared by fitting multivariate logistic regression models that adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, and year of treatment initiation or hyperlipidaemia diagnosis. We found that there were many differences in the baseline characteristics, such as number of general practitioner visits, diagnosis and severity of cardiovascular diseases, and concurrent medications, between the 25 331 patients who received and the 16 287 patients who did not receive LLDs. We also noted that patients with statin therapy had more prior hospitalization, more recent myocardial infarction/stroke, and more concurrent cardiovascular medications, than those patients who received other LLDs. Patients who received LLDs in primary care, especially patients with statin therapy, were more likely to be elderly and to have more concomitant severe cardiovascular comorbidities than those hyperlipidaemic patients who did not receive LLDs. Examining the medical records of individuals eligible for LLD therapy is an important first step in selectively targeting who will experience the greatest benefit to risk ratio for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia, and is an important step in avoiding confounding by indication when designing epidemiological studies comparing the risks and benefits of treatments for hyperlipidaemia.}

The primary endpoint was time to death. Secondary endpoints were 2-year incidence of hospital admission for angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, coronary angiography, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The 147 patients with Type 2 diabetes had significantly worse survival with an increase in relative hazard of 67% compared with non-diabetic patients. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking status, prior heart failure, prior angina, delay to hospitalization, site of infarction, drug therapy with aspirin, beta-blockers, streptokinase and hyperlipidaemia and treated hypertension, Type 2 diabetes was still associated with a 40% higher death rate compared with people without diabetes (P < 0.05) There was no significant difference in death rates in those aged over 70 years, but an indication of a trend in younger individuals with a four-fold increase in death rate in those with diabetes aged < 60 years, compared with a rate ratio of 2.6 in those with diabetes aged 61-70 years. Among hospitalized patients with first acute myocardial infarction, Type 2 diabetes mellitus is consistently associated with increased mortality and increased hospital admission for heart failure. The estimated 4-year survival rate is only 50%. Our results indicate that younger subjects with Type 2 diabetes and acute myocardial infarction are a high-risk group deserving of special study, and support the argument for aggressive targeting of coronary risk factors among patients with Type 2 diabetes.}

Over 50% of persons with Sneddon syndrome describe a history of headache. We undertook this study to determine the frequency of livedo reticularis in our headache clinic. We performed a retrospective chart review of consecutive patients attending a headache clinic over a period of 6 months. The patients had all been seen by one physician (G.E.T.) who noted the presence or absence of livedo reticularis. The charts were reviewed for age, sex, and vascular risk factors, including current use of oral contraceptives, and history of smoking, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke, or arthritis. Charts from 133 patients with headache were reviewed (24 men [18%], 109 women [82%]; mean age, 42 +/- 13 years). Livedo reticularis was observed in 29 patients (22%) and in a similar proportion in men (25%) and women (21%). When we stratified the migraine population by presence or absence of livedo, we found no significant difference in age (44.5 versus 41.7 years, P =.16). There was a higher frequency of stroke diagnosis in the cohort with livedo reticularis (28%[8 of 29] versus 7%[7 of 104], P =.005), but we found no significant differences in frequency of hypertension, oral contraceptive use, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, arthritis, or cigarette smoking. In our headache clinic, livedo reticularis is present in more than one fifth of patients. A history of stroke is more frequent in this subset of migraineurs, raising the possibility that livedo reticularis can be used as a clinical marker to identify those migraineurs with an increased risk of stroke.}

We performed a planned exploratory analysis of differences in baseline characteristics and risk factors between women and men enrolled in AAASPS, a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, controlled trial. Frequencies of vascular risk factors and related conditions, medical therapies, stroke subtypes, and vascular territories were compared between women and men by 1-way ANOVA and Fisher's exact test where appropriate. A total of 1087 African American patients (574 women, 513 men) enrolled between December 1995 and June 1999. Women had higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, family history of stroke, and no reported leisure exercise. Men had higher rates of smoking and heavy alcohol use. Few differences were noted in proportions of stroke subtype or proportions receiving preventive therapy. AAASPS represents the largest enrollment of African American women in a recurrent stroke prevention study. Our data suggest that African American women in a clinical trial differ from men in the frequency of key vascular risk factors. Although limited, these data provide an important first characterization of sex differences in African Americans with stroke.}

The FHS was obtained from 421 consecutive acute stroke patients and from 239 matched control subjects. Positive FHS was observed in 49% of all stroke patients compared with 28% of the control subjects [adjusted OR=2.06 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.42-3.00)]. Haematomas, ischaemic strokes, and from the ischaemic strokes, both large and small artery disease strokes were strongly associated with positive FHS compared with the control subjects [adjusted OR=2.06 (95% CI 9-3.04), 2.07 (95% CI 1.09-3.91), 2.05 (95% CI 1.24-3.38), and 2.76 (95% CI 1.55-4.91), respectively]. There was no difference between maternal and paternal heritable contribution.In conclusion, FHS was found in this study to be an independent risk factor for all strokes combined, for each stroke type, and for the large and small-artery disease stroke subtypes, but not for the cardioembolic and undetermined stroke subtypes.}

  abstract = {Moderately elevated plasma homocysteine levels have been established as independent risk factors in vascular disease, including ischemic stroke. Recently, a common mutation (C677T) in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene reducing the activity of MTHFR and increasing homocysteine levels in plasma was reported. The C677T MTHFR mutation may be a risk factor for ischemic stroke, but the results of previous studies have been conflicting. One possible explanation is that the association with the MTHFR genotype may be different according to gender. To investigate the association for ischemic stroke, we conducted a case-control study of 77 hospital cases (49 men and 28 women) with ischemic stroke and 229 (120 men and 109 women) control subjects in Japanese. The prevalence of conventional vascular risk factors and MTHFR genotypes were determined in case and controls. After adjustment by multiple analysis in all there was no statistical significance in MTHFR genotypes. The conventional vascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 17.21), hypertension (adjusted OR, 4.67), smoking habit (adjusted OR, 4.70), and hyperlipidemia (adjusted OR, 2.73) were identified independently associated with ischemic stroke. With a separate sex analysis it was identified that the relationship of the MTHFR T/T gneotype was statisticaly significant in women (adjusted OR, 9.49; 95% CI, 1.75-51.47, P=0.0091). The relevance of the MTHFR T/T mutation appears to be restricted to women, suggesting a role of female hormones in the resistance to elevated homocysteine levels due to the MTHFR T/T mutation.}

  abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that atherosclerosis is an inflammatory condition. Serum levels of inflammatory markers may serve as measures of the severity of atherosclerosis and risk of stroke. We sought to determine whether tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and TNF receptor levels are associated with carotid plaque thickness. The Northern Manhattan Stroke Study is a community-based study of stroke risk factors. For this cross-sectional analysis, inflammatory marker levels, including TNF-alpha and TNF receptors 1 and 2, were measured by immunoassay in stroke-free community subjects undergoing carotid duplex Doppler ultrasound. Maximal carotid plaque thickness (MCPT) was measured for each subject. Analyses were stratified by age < 70 and > or =70 years. Simple and multiple linear regression analyses were used to calculate the association between marker levels and MCPT. Multiple logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% CIs for the association of inflammatory markers with MCPT > or =1.5 mm (>75th percentile), after adjustment for demographic and potential medical confounding factors. The mean age of the 279 subjects was 67.6+/-8.5 years; 49% were men; 63% were Hispanic, 17% black, and 17% white. Mean values for TNF-alpha and its receptors were as follows: TNF-alpha, 1.88+/-3.97 ng/mL; TNF receptor 1, 2.21+/-0.99 ng/mL; and TNF receptor 2, 4.85+/-2.23 ng/mL. Mean MCPT was elevated in those in the highest quartiles compared with lowest quartiles of TNF receptor 1 and 2 (1.24 versus 0.79 mm and 1.23 versus 0.80 mm, respectively). Among those aged < 70 years, TNF receptor 1 and 2 were associated with an increase in MCPT (mean difference=0.36 mm, P=0.01 for TNF receptor 1 and mean difference=0.10 mm, P=0.04 for TNF receptor 2). After adjustment for sex, race-ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, LDL cholesterol, smoking, and body mass index, associations remained (mean difference=0.36 mm, P=0.001 for TNF receptor 1 and mean difference=0.09 mm, P=0.051 for TNF receptor 2). There was no association for TNF receptors in those aged > or = 70 years old and no association for TNF-alpha in either age group. Among those aged < 70 years, each unit increase in TNF receptor level increased the odds of the participant's having MCPT > or =1.5 mm (adjusted odds ratio=4.7; 95% CI, 1.7 to 15.4 for TNF receptor 1; odds ratio=1.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.9 for TNF receptor 2). Relative elevation in TNF receptor levels, but not TNF-alpha, is associated with carotid atherosclerosis among individuals aged < 70 years in this multiethnic, urban population. Chronic subclinical infection or inflammation may account for this association, and modification of these inflammatory pathways may provide a novel approach to stroke prevention.}

We analyzed the data from 1,000 patients with acute cerebral infarctions registered with the Yonsei Stroke Registry (YSR) which is the first prospective hospital-based observational study in Korea. All patients had cerebral infarctions and presented within 7 days of onset. CT or MRI was performed in all patients and a vascular imaging study (digital subtraction or magnetic resonance angiography) was conducted in 53.9% of the patients. Subtype classification was made through a consensus approach based on the strict application of TOAST criteria. The mean age of patients was 62 +/- 12 years, and 60.8% were males. Undetermined cause (UD) was the most frequent subtype (40.6%), which was followed by lacunar stroke (LS 21.5%), cardiac embolism (CE 18.3%), large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA 16.5%) and other determined causes (3.1%). Hypertension was found in 64.3%, smoking in 35.2%, diabetes mellitus in 26.9%, hypercholesterolemia in 24.1%, high hematocrit (> or = 50%) in 21.8%, clinically identified potential cardiac sources of embolism in 18.3%, a history of previous stroke in 22.0% and a history of previous transient ischemic attack in 4.7%. Recurrent stroke was associated with a higher number of risk factors (p < 0.001) and a higher incidence of LAA (p = 0.003) than the first stroke. Vertebrobasilar artery territorial infarction was found in 39.8%, which was associated with higher incidences of LAA and LS and a lower incidence of CE than carotid artery territorial lesions (p = 0.001). The 30-day mortality rate was 5.3% and cerebral herniation caused early death in 52%. The distribution of stroke subtypes in the YSR was largely comparable with that of western registries. The highest incidence of UD might be related to the strict application of TOAST criteria.}

  abstract = {Retinal microvascular abnormalities reflect damage from hypertension and other vascular processes. We examined the relation of such abnormalities to incident stroke. A cohort of 10358 men and women (aged 51 to 72 years) living in four US communities underwent retinal photography and standard grading for retinal microvascular abnormalities. The calibres of all retinal arterioles and venules were measured after digital conversion of the photographs, and a summary arteriole-to-venule ratio (AVR) was calculated as an index of arteriolar narrowing (smaller AVR indicates greater narrowing). Cases of incident stroke admitted to hospital were identified and validated by case record reviews. Over an average of 3.5 years, 110 participants had incident strokes. After adjustment for age, sex, race, 6-year mean arterial blood pressure, diabetes, and other stroke risk factors, most retinal microvascular characteristics were predictive of incident stroke, with adjusted relative risks of 2.58 (1.59-4.20) for any retinopathy, 3.11 (1.71-5.65) for microaneurysms, 3.08 (1.42-6.68) for soft exudates, 2.55 (1.27-5.14) for blot haemorrhages, 2.26 (1.00-5.12) for flame-shaped haemorrhages, and 1.60 (1.03-2.47) for arteriovenous nicking. The relative risk of stroke increased with decreasing AVR (p=0.03). The associations were similar for ischaemic strokes specifically, and for strokes in individuals with hypertension, either with or without diabetes. Retinal microvascular abnormalities are related to incident stroke. The findings support a microvascular role in the pathogenesis of stroke. They suggest that retinal photography may be useful for cerebrovascular-risk stratification in appropriate populations.}

The aetiological and prognostic factors in this population were also analysed. Few data exist concerning the outcome, and aetiological and prognostic factors, of patients with myocardial infarction and angiographically absolutely normal coronary arteries. Ninety-one patients (34 females/57 males; mean age 50+/-13 years, range 24--78 years) admitted with an acute myocardial infarction had absolutely normal coronary arteries at the angiogram performed 6.2+/-4 days (range 1--15 days) after the myocardial infarction, defined by smooth contours and no focal reduction (NC). Of the 91 NC patients, 71 were evaluated prospectively, alongside a systematic search of all aetiological factors reported in the literature. The NC patients were matched for age, sex, and the same period of myocardial infarction onset with a group of 91 patients with coronary artery stenosis (>50% diameter stenosis) at the angiogram performed 7.3+/-4 days (range 1--15 days) after the myocardial infarction (SC). The percent of smokers was similar between the two groups; higher prevalence rates of coronary heart disease family history, obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and diabetes mellitus were found in SC (P=0.043 to 0.0001). In NC, coronary spasm was found in 15.5%, congenital coagulation disorders in 12.8%, collagen tissue disorders in 2.2%, embolization in 2.2%, and oral contraceptive use in 1.1%. Left ventricular ejection fraction at hospital discharge was higher in NC (60%+/-13%) than in SC (55%+/-13%, P=0.04). The mean follow-up was 35 months (range 1--100 months). Kaplan-Meier event-free survival, with the combined end-point defined as death, reinfarction, heart failure and stroke was 75% in NC vs 50% in SC (P<0.0001). Survival rate was 94.5% in NC compared to 92% in SC (ns). Univariate predictors of events in NC were left ventricular ejection fraction (P=0.03), age (P=0.02), diabetes (P=0.01), and smoking (P=0.03). Using Cox multivariate analysis, independent predictors of long-term outcome in NC patients were left ventricular ejection fraction (P=0.003) and diabetes (P=0.004). Aetiological factors, predominantly coronary spasm and inherited coagulation disorder, can be detected in only one third of the patients with myocardial infarction and absolutely normal coronary angiograms despite a systematic search in a prospective population. Mortality rates are similar but morbidity is lower in myocardial infarction patients with absolutely normal coronary angiography compared with those with coronary artery stenosis. The only two independent factors predictive of poor outcome in myocardial infarction patients with normal coronary arteries are left ventricular function and diabetes.}

All subjects were aged 55 years and older and participated in the Rotterdam Study. Mean follow-up was 4.2 years (range, 0.1 to 6.5 years). We evaluated which correlates of coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease contribute to the prediction of either a new incident myocardial infarction or a stroke. Logistic regression modeling and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC area) were used to quantify the predictive value of the established risk factors and the added value of IMT. The ROC area of a model with age and sex only was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.69). Independent risk factors were previous myocardial infarction and stroke, diabetes mellitus, smoking, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and total and HDL cholesterol levels. These risk factors increased the ROC area from 0.65 to 0.72 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.75). This model correctly predicted 17% of all subjects with coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. When common carotid IMT was added to the previous model, the ROC area increased to 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.78). When only the IMT measurement was used, the ROC area was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.68 to 0.74), and 14% of all subjects were correctly predicted. There was no difference in ROC area when different measurement sites were used. Adding IMT to a risk function for coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease does not result in a substantial increase in the predictive value when used as a screening tool.}

  abstract = {Ischemic stroke in young adults has not fully been studied in Japan. The purpose of this study is to clarify the clinical features and pathogenetic mechanisms of ischemic stroke in young adults. From January 1990 to June 2000, 133 (7.1%) of 1,862 consecutive patients with ischemic stroke were aged 16 to 50 years (92 men and 41 women, aged of 42.6 +/- 7.7 years). We divided the patients into three groups according to the age of stroke onset; 16 to 40 (group A, n = 38), 41 to 45 (group B, n = 33), and 46 to 50 years (group C, n = 62). Sex, vascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and smoking, cerebrovascular lesions, potential cardiac sources of emboli (emboligenic cardiac diseases), and clinical categories of stroke were examined. We compared them among the three groups. Men predominated in the all groups. Patients in the group C had more frequently hypertension (p < .0005) and diabetes mellitus (p < .05) than those in the group A and B. The vertebrobasilar infarcts were often revealed in the group A but not in the group B and C (p < .01). No significant difference was observed about the incidence of emboligenic cardiac diseases among the three groups. Out of 46 emboligenic cardiac diseases, the most frequent one was patent foramen ovale (15 patients), whereas nonvalvular atrial fibrillation was documented only in five. Fourteen of 20 patients with significant atherosclerotic arterial lesions were found in the group C, whereas 13 of 16 patients with nonatherosclerotic vasculopathies in the group A. Ulcerated atheroma in the aortic arch was detected in two patients, both in the group C. Overall, clinical categories of stroke were identified as lacunar (Lac) in 34 patients (26%), atherothrombotic (AT) in 16 (12%), cardioembolic (CE) in 44 (33%), miscellaneous (Misc) in 27 (20%), and undetermined in 12 (9%). The most frequent cause of Misc (nine patients) was arterial dissection, occurring mostly in the vertebrobasilar system (eight of nine patients). Misc was most frequent in the group A (p < .0001), and Lac was so in the group C (p < .001). Seventy-six percent of patients in the group A and 61% of those in the group B were attributed to nonatherosclerotic causes. In contrast, 61% of patients in the group C had atherosclerotic causes. Incidence of athero- and arteriosclerosis as causes of ischemic stroke was apparently increased beyond 45 years of age. Patients < or = 45 years are likely to have various and unique etiologies for ischemic stroke. A specific diagnostic approach is strongly recommended for young patients with ischemic stroke.}

These are: the lipid theory, the hemodynamic theory, the fibrin incrustation theory, the nonspecific mesenchymal hypothesis and the response to injury hypothesis. Based on the above theories the sequence of events in atherogenesis is analyzed. The classification of the atherosclerotic lesions according to Stary (types I-VI) and their characteristics appear in a table. The epidemiology and the role of the following risk factors are presented in detail: age, sex, lipid abnormalities, cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, obesity, and hemostatic factors. In addition, less common genetically determined associations like homocystinuria, Tangier disease, Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome (progeria), Werner's syndrome, radiation induced atherosclerosis and the implications of Chlamydia pneumoniae on the arterial wall are discussed.}

Our objective was to determine the clinical characteristics and course of cardioembolic infarcts (ICCE) comparing them with infarcts due to other aetiologies (ICNCE). We made a prospective study of 354 patients admitted to hospital over a period of one year, after excluding transient ischaemia and parenchymatous/subarachnoid hemorrhage. Two groups were established: ICCE (29.4%) and ICNCE (70.6%), comparing age, sex, risk factors and course of the illness. Subsequently a study lasing two years was done to assess the recurrence rate. The ICCE patients were older (75.89 compared with 72.58, p = 0.004), often know the exact time of onset of their symptoms (p = 0.015) and usually are admitted to hospital during the first six hours of their illness (p = 0.01). There was a significantly higher incidence of ischemic cardiopathy or auricular fibrillation (p = 0.0052); p = 0.005); more complications arose (p = 0.000); stay in hospital was longer (13.62 as compared to 11.8 days; p = 0.035), there was a lower weekly BI score (p = 0.0023) and higher mortality (p = 0.000). In the subgroup of 70 patients evaluated two years later 11 cases recurred, with no difference observed between the anticoagulant and anti-aggregant groups. The ICCE occurs in older patients, they develop worse neurological defects, have a worse short-term prognosis, develop more complications and have significantly greater mortality.}

ELISA was used for the analysis of IgG, IgM, and IgA aCL. IgM-aCL were present in 11.4% of patients (14/123) who developed stroke and in 4. 1% of individuals (10/241) who remained healthy (P=0.013, OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.28 to 6.89). The OR for the levels of IgM-aCL was 1.34 (P=0. 01, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.68) without adjustment for other risk factors and 1.24 when adjusted for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, and use of smokeless tobacco (P=0.077, 95% CI 0. 98 to 1.56). There was no difference between patients and controls for the prevalence or level of IgG-aCL and IgA-aCL and also no difference between patients with cerebral hemorrhage and cerebral infarction for the prevalence of all 3 isotypes of aCL. We conclude that aCL are associated with future stroke but do not constitute an independent risk factor.}

To explore (1) whether the benefits of active treatment were evenly distributed across 4 strata, prospectively defined according to sex and previous cardiovascular complications, and (2) whether the morbidity and mortality results were influenced by age, level of systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP), smoking or drinking habits, or diabetes mellitus at enrollment. Eligible patients had to be 60 years or older with a sitting systolic BP of 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic BP less than 95 mm Hg. After stratification for center, sex, and previous cardiovascular complications, 1253 patients were assigned to active treatment starting with nitrendipine (10-40 mg/d), with the possible addition of captopril (12.5-50.0 mg/d), and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-50 mg/d). In the 1141 control patients, matching placebos were used similarly. Male sex, previous cardiovascular complications, older age, higher systolic BP or lower diastolic BP, living in northern China, smoking, and diabetes mellitus significantly and independently increased the risk of 1 or more of the following end points: total or cardiovascular mortality, all fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular end points, all strokes, and all cardiac end points. In the placebo-control group diabetes raised the risk of all end points 2- to 3-fold (P< or =.05). However, active treatment reduced the excess risk associated with diabetes to a nonsignificant level (P values ranging from .12-.86) except for cardiovascular mortality (P = .04). Cox regression with adjustments applied for significant covariates suggested that active treatment may reduce total mortality more (P = .06) in women and stroke more (P = .07) in men and that it may provide better protection against cardiac end points in nonsmokers than smokers (P = .04). Otherwise, the benefits of active treatment were equally manifest, regardless of the enrollment characteristics of the patients, and regardless of whether active treatment consisted of only nitrendipine or of nitrendipine associated with other active drugs. In elderly Chinese patients with isolated systolic hypertension, stepwise antihypertensive drug treatment, starting with the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nitrendipine, improved prognosis. The benefit was particularly evident in diabetic patients; for cardiac end points it tended to be larger in nonsmokers. Otherwise, the benefit of active treatment was not significantly influenced by the characteristics of the patients at enrollment in the trial.}

There was no difference in the levels or in the prevalence of IgG, IgA, and IgM autoantibodies against copper-oxidized LDL or MDA-LDL between patients and controls. Risk ratios for these antibodies, when adjusted for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and smoking habits, did not confer a risk of stroke. Serum triglycerides (1.7 versus 1.4 mmol/L, P=0.01), fasting blood sugar, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group, as was the prevalence of hypertension (51.8% versus 27.4%, P<0.0001) and diabetes mellitus (9.6% versus 0.8%, P<0.001).

  abstract = {Determination of circulating activated platelets may be helpful to estimate the prognosis and to stratify therapies in arterial vascular disorders including stroke. We used flow cytometry and phase contrast microscopy to study whether the fraction of platelets expressing p-selectin and CD63 and the fraction of platelets with shape change are increased in patients with acute and previous cerebrovascular ischemia. The proportion of platelets expressing activation dependent antigens was higher in patients with acute (n = 24; p-selectin: 8.23 +/- 4.21%; CD63: 3.53 +/- 2.53%) and with previous cerebrovascular ischemia (n = 46; 3.86 +/- 1.98%; 2.80 +/- 1.79%) as compared to age- and sex-matched control subjects (n = 35; 2.17 +/- 0.96%; 1.79 +/- 0.75%; p < or = 0.005, respectively). In patients with previous ischemia, there was no difference between treatment with aspirin (n = 25) or phenprocoumon (n = 21). Hypertension, diabetes mellitus and smoking were not associated with increased antigen expression (analysis of variance). The fraction of discoid platelets and platelet counts were not significantly different between groups. Our results indicate increased expression of platelet neoantigens in acute and to a less degree in previous cerebrovascular ischemia. Ongoing platelet activation after cerebrovascular ischemia despite therapy with aspirin or phenprocoumon indicates that new anti-platelet drugs may be of benefit for these patients. Flow cytometry appears to be a useful tool to assess platelet function in cerebrovascular ischemia.}

We designed a study to compare the clinical topographic and prognostic characteristics of patients with hypertensive and non-hypertensive lacunar infarcts. We selected 51 patients with lacunar infarcts: in 23 (45%) arterial hypertension was the only etiological factor recognized. In 28 (55%) other risk factors (16 diabetes mellitus, 17 cardiopathy, 8 hyperlipemia, 13 cigarette smoking and 11 alcoholism) were seen. We evaluated the form of presentation, the type of infarct and whether this was associated with headache. The degree of defect was determined on admission using the Canadian scale. The size of the infarct was measured on CT or RM, using whichever measurement was greater. The evolution of the condition was determined on the Canadian scale and the index of Barthel after three months. Age and sex distribution was similar to both groups. Motor hemiparesia was the commonest lacunar syndrome and the distribution was similar. There was no difference in form of onset, association with headache or neurological defect between the hypertensive and non-hypertensive lacunar infarcts. The topographical distribution, the presentation of single or multiple lesions, the size of the infarcts and the prognosis were similar in both groups. Lacunar infarcts, whether hypertensive or not, show no differences regarding clinical, neuro-radiological or evolutionary characteristics.}

This study was carried out to examine recent trends in cerebrovascular disease mortality in Singapore, and to study corresponding changes in stroke risk factors in our population. The Registry of Births and Deaths, Singapore, publishes annual reports on births and deaths. The cause of death is coded using the International Classification of Diseases Revisions 8 (1969-1978) and 9 (1979 onwards). Data for this study were obtained using rubrics 430-438. Death rates were age- and sex-standardized to the World Standard Population, and separately for males and females. Cerebrovascular disease risk factor patterns were derived from national epidemiological health surveys conducted from 1970 and 1994. The absolute number of deaths annually from cerebrovascular disease rose from 1041 in 1970 to 1692 in 1994. Crude death rates remained stable at 50-60 per 100000, accounting for 10-12% of all deaths. Standardized death rates showed a distinct fall from 99 per 100000 in 1976 to 59 per 100000 in 1994, 101 to 60 per 100000 in males and 95 to 57 per 100000 in females. National health surveys have shown a fall in the prevalence of undetected hypertension, smoking and hyperlipidaemia; the prevalence of obesity was unchanged, while that of diabetes mellitus rose over the same period. The mortality trends found in this study are unlikely to be due to changing fashions in coding or inadequate data collection. As in many countries in the world, cerebrovascular disease mortality in Singapore has fallen over the last 25 years; this may in part be related to the decline in stroke risk factors in our population.}

Our research was designed to investigate the association of this organism with strokes and transient cerebral ischemia. Antibodies to C pneumoniae were measured in 176 patients with stroke or transient cerebral ischemia and 1518 control subjects with noncardiovascular, nonpulmonary disorders. Acute infection or reinfection was defined by IgG > or =512 or IgM > or =8 or fourfold rise in IgG, and previous infection was defined by IgG 64 to 256 or IgA > or =8. Logistic regression was used to examine the influences of ethnic origin, age, sex, smoking habit, diabetes mellitus, steroid medication, and social deprivation on antibody levels. Some patients underwent CT and carotid ultrasound examinations and cholesterol, triglyceride, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor estimations. We found that 13.6% of stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients and 5.7% of control subjects had antibody titers suggesting acute C pneumoniae (re)infection, while 32.4% of stroke/TIA patients and 12.7% of control subjects had titers suggesting previous infection (P<.05). Stroke/TIA patients differed from control subjects in their levels of acute and previous infection, with adjusted odds ratios of 4.2 (95% CI, 2.5 to 7.1) and 4.4 (95% CI, 3.0 to 6.5), respectively. These did not differ notably between strokes resulting from major nonhemorrhagic infarcts, small-vessel infarcts, or hemorrhage. Cholesterol, triglyceride, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor concentrations showed no apparent association with titers. These data support the association of cerebral vascular disease with previous C pneumoniae infection and the association of stroke and transient cerebral ischemia with recrudescence of infection.}

The prevalence of cerebrovascular disease among residents of the Lanyang Basin on the northeast coast of Taiwan was surveyed to examine its association with exposure to arsenic in well water. A total of 8102 men and women from 3901 households were recruited in this study. The status of cerebrovascular disease of study subjects was identified through home-visit personal interviews and ascertained by review of hospital medical records according to the World Health Organization criteria. Information on consumption of well water, sociodemographic characteristics, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption habits, as well as personal and family history of diseases, was also obtained. Arsenic concentration in the well water of each household was determined by hydride generation and atomic absorption spectrometry. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate multivariate-adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for various risk factors of cerebrovascular disease. A significant dose-response relationship was observed between arsenic concentration in well water and prevalence of cerebrovascular disease after adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption. The biological gradient was even more prominent for cerebral infarction, showing multivariate-adjusted odds ratios of 1.0, 3.4, 4.5, and 6.9, respectively, for those who consumed well water with an arsenic content of 0, 0.1 to 50.0, 50.1 to 299.9, and > 300 micrograms/L. Long-term exposure to inorganic arsenic from well water was associated with an increased prevalence of cerebrovascular disease, especially cerebral infarction.}

However, little is known about this association in nondiabetic subjects. Specifically, it is not known whether microalbuminuria is related to an early stage of atherosclerosis manifested as increased intima-media thickness (IMT) of carotid arteries. We investigated the relationship between microalbuminuria and carotid artery IMT in 991 nondiabetic and 450 NIDDM subjects aged 40 to 69 years. Microalbuminuria was defined as albumin-to-creatinine ratio > or = 2 mg/mmol in a morning spot urine sample. B-mode ultrasound was used to assess the IMT of the common and internal carotid arteries. Altogether 13.9% of nondiabetic and 27.6% of NIDDM subjects had microalbuminuria, and 31.1% of nondiabetic and 50.8% of NIDDM subjects had hypertension. Subjects with microalbuminuria had greater common carotid artery (CCA) IMT than those without microalbuminuria (nondiabetic: 0.84 +/- 0.02 versus 0.80 +/- 0.01 mm, P = .010; NIDDM: 0.89 +/- 0.02 versus 0.86 +/- 0.01 mm, P = .152; combined: 0.86 +/- 0.01 versus 0.82 +/- 0.01, P = .005). The association of microalbuminuria and CCA IMT was independent of age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, and lipoprotein levels. Although further adjustment for hypertension in the multivariate linear regression analysis attenuated the difference in CCA IMT between subjects with and without microalbuminuria, this difference continued to be significant (combined: 0.86 +/- 0.01 versus 0.83 +/- 0.01, P = .015). In contrast to CCA IMT, microalbuminuria was not related to ICA IMT. Microalbuminuria was associated with increased CCA IMT. This relationship was only partly mediated by hypertension. Thus, microalbuminuria is related to atherosclerosis at an early stage of the disease process.}

On the basis of prior literature, we divided patients into those with aCL < or = 40 GPL (n = 111; mean age, 63 +/- 14 years; mean follow-up, 1.95 years) and those with aCL > 40 GPL (n = 21; mean age, 54 +/- 20 years; mean follow-up, 1.50 years). There was no difference between groups for prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, atrial fibrillation, prior TIA, or sex. The GPL > 40 group was younger (54 +/- 20 versus 63 +/- 14 years; P = .055), had more prior strokes [9/21 (48%) versus 27/111 (20%); P = .030], more frequent subsequent thrombo-occlusive events and death [15/21 (71%) versus 51/111 (48%); P = .030], and a shorter median time (years) to event (0.15 versus 0.61, log rank P = .005). The risk ratio for recurrent event and death with GPL > 40 obtained from Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for prior strokes, prior TIAs, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and cigarette smoking was 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 3.5; P = .051). Our data suggest that subsequent thrombo-occlusive events and death after focal cerebral ischemia associated with IgG aCL may occur sooner and more frequently with GPL > 40.}

The purpose of this study is to clarify clinical characteristics and circumstances associated with the genesis of TCD-detected microemboli. Ninety-one cases with more than 30% stenosis of the internal carotid arteries were studied. TCD monitoring was carried out for an hour at the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery of each case using a 2-MHz pulse-wave transcranial Doppler device, and high intensity transient signals were counted as microemboli. Digital subtraction angiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were also performed in all cases. Microemboli were detected in 30 of 91 cases. Microemboli were significantly well detected in cases with a history of ischemic event and/or cerebral infarction recognized by MRI. Detection of microemboli had no relation to sex, age or clinical risk factors (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and smoke habituation). In contrast, detection of microemboli was significantly related to decrease in cerebral blood flow recognized by SPECT, severity of stenosis and wall irregularity of lesion recognized by angiography. Microemboli can be found in a significantly high percentage of these clinical conditions, which may be risk factors for embolic stroke caused by extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis.}

A cohort study (patients with high blood pressure). 707 hypertensive patients were studied (Hypertension Register) in what concerns stroke incidence until 1992 (n = 126), considering one case per individual. The following variables were analysed: age, sex, body mass index (Quetelet), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, types of hypertension (JNC-IV), left ventricular hypertrophy, changes in ST segment and T wave (Minnesota Code), fundi, angina pectoris, heart failure, central nervous (neurological) disturbances, antihypertensive treatment, smoking, serum potassium, serum sodium, blood urea, creatinine, uric acid, blood sugar, diabetes and cholesterol, in the initial record. Individually, in relation to the control of hypertension, the subjects were classified according to the casual recording of normal blood pressure, the absence of drug treatment, diastolic pressure > 114 mmHg and, at the end of 1992, according to survival, causes of death and follow-up. Stroke risk factors have been identified by multivariate analysis (Cox regression model). The survival probability (without stroke) was defined by Kaplan-Meier method. It was possible to maintain the epidemiological surveillance, from 1975 to 1992, of 598 cases. From those, 109 hypertensive patients were victims of at least one episode of non transient cerebral ischaemia, during their follow-up of 10.5 years. From the characteristics studied, only five were identified at risk factors. The adjusted relative risks and confidence intervals (95% CI) were the following: age: 1.08 (1.06-1.10); diastolic pressure > 114 mmHg: 1.96 (1.32-2.91); neurological disturbances 4.64 (2.99-7.2); diabetes: 2.57 (1.62-4.05) and left ventricular hypertrophy: 1.34 (1.13-1.58). As far as stroke is concerned: a) Age, diabetes, a casual measurement of diastolic blood pressure > 114 mmHg and left ventricular hypertrophy (electrocardiogram) were the risk factors identified; b) Prevention should include blood pressure and diabetes control, although this disease has shown more risk than a casual measurement of severe hypertension; c) Its occurrence, in this model, has only partly been explained, therefore it has become necessary to deepen the study of the risk profile.}

For any severe (> or = 50%) CAS, crude prevalences were 2.8%, 4.7%, 9.4% and 7.6%. The prevalence of any severe CAS was higher in NDM (p < 0.01) and KDM subjects (p = 0.07) than in NGT subjects.

In univariate logistic regression analysis, HbA1c, serum fructosamine, fasting and 2-h post-load glucose were significantly associated with any severe CAS. In multivariate analyses controlling for other risk factors, only HbA1c and 2-h post-load plasma glucose remained significantly associated (odds ratios: 1.29 per % and 1.09 per mmol/l, respectively) in separate models. No association could be shown between either fasting or 2-h post-load specific insulin and any severe CAS in either univariate or multivariate analyses.

Ultrasound examinations included measurements of intima-media thickness (IMT) and interadventitial and lumen diameters of the common carotid arteries and quantification of atherosclerotic plaques in extracranial carotid arteries. Men showed greater IMT interadventitial and lumen diameters of the common carotid arteries than did women. In both sexes, common IMT and plaque score were positively associated with common interadventitial and lumen diameters. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that male sex, body height and weight, common IMT, plaque score, systolic blood pressure, and alcohol consumption were positively and independently related to lumen diameter. On the other hand, an independent negative association was observed between low density lipoprotein cholesterol and lumen diameter. In 59- to 71-year-old subjects, increased IMT and atherosclerotic plaques were accompanied by an increase in lumen diameter of the common carotid arteries, indicating an overcompensation. Luminal enlargement observed with several risk factors and with high blood pressure in particular might be partially counteracted by high lipid levels.}

We wished to determine whether a noninvasive measurement can serve as an indicator of clinically manifest atherosclerotic disease and to determine which of the two variables, CCA IMT or ICA IMT, is a better correlate. IMT of the CCA and ICA was measured with duplex ultrasound in 5117 of 5201 individuals enrolled in the Cardiovascular Health Study, a study of the risk factors and the natural history of cardiovascular disease in adults aged 65 years or more. Histories of CHD, peripheral arterial disease, and cerebrovascular disease were obtained during baseline examination. Risk factors included cholesterol levels, cigarette smoking, elevated blood pressure, diabetes, age, and sex. Relationships between risk factors and IMT were studied by multiple regression analysis and canonical variate analysis. Prediction of prevalent CHD and ASD by IMT measurements in CCAs and ICAs were made by logistic regression, adjusting for age and sex. IMT measurements of the CCAs and ICAs were greater in persons with CHD and ASD than those without, even after controlling for sex (P < .001). IMT measurements in the ICA were greater than those in the CCA. Risk factors for ASD accounted for 17% and 18% of the variability in IMT in the CCA and ICA, respectively. These same risk factors accounted for 25% of the variability of a composite measurement consisting of the sum of the ICA IMT and CCA IMT. The ability to predict CHD and ASD was greater for ICA IMT (odds ratio [confidence interval]: 1.36 [1.31 to 1.41] and 1.35 [1.25 to 1.44], respectively) than for CCA IMT (1.09 [1.05 to 1.13] and 1.17 [1.09 to 1.25]). Whereas CCA IMT is associated with major risk factors for atherosclerosis and existing CHD and ASD in older adults, this association is not as strong as that for ICA IMT. The combination of these measures relates more strongly to existing CHD and ASD and cerebrovascular disease risk factors than either taken alone.}

The aim of this study was to assess the independent effect of diabetes as a risk factor for stroke. Results from the previous studies of this question have been somewhat inconclusive. We performed a prospective study (average follow-up, 16.4 years) of 8077 men and 8572 women who had participated in risk factor surveys in Eastern Finland in 1972 (20 years of follow-up) and 1977 (15 years of follow-up). Risk factors included in the current analyses were smoking, blood pressure, antihypertensive drug treatment, serum total cholesterol, and diabetes either at baseline or developed during the follow-up. Age- and risk factor-adjusted relative risks for death of stroke were determined with the Cox proportional hazards model. Diabetes mellitus was the strongest risk factor for death from stroke among both men and women in univariate and multivariate analyses. In addition, smoking and systolic blood pressure appeared to be independent risk factors among both sexes, as did serum total cholesterol among men. Men with diabetes at baseline appeared to be at a sixfold increased risk of death from stroke, while relative risk for men who developed diabetes during the follow-up was 1.7. In women, those who were diabetic at baseline were at higher risk of stroke than women who developed diabetes later (relative risks, 8.2 and 3.7, respectively). Of stroke deaths, 16% in men and 33% in women were attributed to diabetes. Diabetic subjects have a very high risk of death from stroke, particularly women. Our data also suggest that the duration of diabetes is an important factor contributing to the risk of stroke.}

The prevalence of symptoms occurring more than once per month was significantly greater with increasing age (p = 0.0003). Dizziness was significantly associated with angina and previous myocardial infarction (p < 0.001) and antihypertensive therapy (p < 0.05) but not with current smoking, diabetes mellitus or previous stroke.}

Average intimal-medial carotid wall thickness (an indicator of atherosclerosis) was measured noninvasively by B-mode ultrasonography in cross-sectional samples of 45- to 64-year-old adults, both blacks and whites, free of symptomatic cardiovascular disease, in four US communities. Sample mean carotid wall thickness was approximately 0.7 mm in women (n = 7956) and 0.8 mm in men (n = 6474). Body mass, waist-to-hip ratio, work physical activity, diabetes, and fasting insulin were associated (P < .05) with carotid wall thickness in the hypothesized direction. Adjusted for age, race, smoking, body mass index, artery depth, and Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities field center, mean wall thickness was greater by 0.02 mm in women and 0.03 mm in men for a 0.07-unit (one SD) larger waist-to-hip ratio. Adjusted mean wall thickness was about 0.07 mm thicker in participants with diabetes mellitus and 0.02 mm thicker in participants with hyperglycemia (fasting glucose 6.4 to 7.7 mmol/L) than in subjects with fasting glucose < 6.4 mmol/L. Adjusted mean wall thickness increased by about 0.02 mm with an increase of 100 mmol/L in fasting serum insulin. Abdominal adiposity, physical inactivity, and abnormal glucose metabolism are associated positively with carotid intimal-medial wall thickness, suggesting these factors contribute to atherogenesis.}

The patients selected for the study had been admitted to the hospital through the emergency department, and were evaluated by means of multidimensional interviews and clinical records: 164 had acute cerebrovascular disease, and 136 cardiovascular disease; 330 patients with nonvascular disease were the controls. The evaluation showed 48% of vascular disease patients to be habitual snorers, but only 30% of the controls; the difference was statistically significant. Compared with the controls, in the cerebrovascular patients the risk (odds ratio) associated with habitual snoring was significantly increased, and of the same order as the risk associated with age over 65 yrs, male gender, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidaemia; whilst the risk associated with hypertension was higher. In the cardiovascular patients, the risk associated with habitual snoring was again significantly increased and of the same order as the risk associated with male gender, body mass index > 29 (kg.m-2), dyslipidaemia, heavy smoking, excessive alcohol intake and hypertension. A logistic regression analysis, entering the variables in the following order: age, gender, body mass index, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, smoking, alcohol, hypertension, and habitual snoring, showed that habitual snoring carries a significant risk factor for stroke and myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for other factors. Since habitual snoring carries a definite risk for acute vascular disease, we conclude that inquiring about it should become routine practice.}

There was no difference between the groups in relation to the abnormal segment on thallium stress tests, aged and sex. Although the number of patients was too small for meaningful statistical analysis, most of the patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia or smoking history were in group 1. Thus, the patient population with abnormal results on radionuclide exercise tests and angiographically normal coronary arteries probably comprises two groups: a) patients with decreased diastolic and relatively decreased systolic performances which might reflect coronary flow disturbances, and b) patients with normal diastolic and systolic performances, probably reflecting "true false positive thallium stress test".}

For ischemic strokes, atrial fibrillation and the presence of ischemic heart disease were risk factors only for those aged 70 years and above, while smoking and left ventricular hypertrophy were risk factors only for those below 70 years. Hypertension and glucose intolerance were risk factors for both age groups, although the effect of glucose intolerance was less marked in the older group. No marked difference in serum lipids and lipoproteins as risk factors was observed between the two age groups. Hypertension was the only demonstrable risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke in the younger, but not in the older, group. Risk factors for ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes are different in elderly compared with younger subjects, with the possibility that certain risk factors for ischemic strokes, in contrast to those for hemorrhagic strokes, may be modifiable even in subjects aged 70 years or above.}

We studied the course of 101 sequential renal allograft recipients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, transplanted between 10 November 1980 and 1 April 1986. Arterial disorders were tabulated from medical records and interviews with individual patients, their families, and their private physicians. Documentation of discrete arterial events included recorded physical examinations, radiographic studies, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, peripheral vascular flow studies, and operative reports. The prevalence of preoperative arterial disease was compared with the occurrence of new arterial events after kidney transplantation. Within a mean follow-up period of 47 mo, a 30% absolute mortality rate was observed. Of these deaths, 57% resulted from arterial disorders. Clinical manifestations of arterial disease were recognized in 41% of recipients before transplantation, and 78% of these patients suffered new vascular events after transplantation. Of the entire sample, 57% developed at least one new complication of arterial disease after transplantation, whereas only 34% had no vascular diagnosis before or after transplantation. Cerebral, coronary, and peripheral arterial complications after transplantation occurred in 14, 28, and 36% of the patients, respectively. The corresponding incidences of stroke, myocardial infarction, and amputation were 12, 14, and 25%. Pretransplant coronary artery disease predisposed to new coronary events after transplantation, but only peripheral arterial complications occurred more often after transplantation compared with the preoperative period. The probability of arterial complications or death correlated with patient age at first transplant and duration of diabetes but not with sex or smoking history. Intrinsic arterial disease in diabetic renal allograft recipients contributes heavily to the long-term morbidity and mortality after transplantation and poses the major threat to survival. Diabetic transplant candidates greater than 35 yr of age or with clinical evidence of arterial disease should undergo an extensive vascular assessment, including stress thallium myocardial imaging and/or coronary arteriography. Such recipients should receive careful preoperative counseling about their excess risk for subsequent arterial disorders.}

The stroke risk factors included in the profile are age, systolic blood pressure, the use of antihypertensive therapy, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, prior cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, cardiac failure, or intermittent claudication), atrial fibrillation, and left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiogram. Based on 472 stroke events occurring during 10 years' follow-up from biennial examinations 9 and 14, stroke probabilities were computed using the Cox proportional hazards model for each sex based on a point system. On the basis of the risk factors in the profile, which can be readily determined on routine physical examination in a physician's office, stroke risk can be estimated. An individual's risk can be related to the average risk of stroke for persons of the same age and sex. The information that one's risk of stroke is several times higher than average may provide the impetus for risk factor modification. It may also help to identify persons at substantially increased stroke risk resulting from borderline levels of multiple risk factors such as those with mild or borderline hypertension and facilitate multifactorial risk factor modification.}

Reported regular alcohol consumption was compared with the presence and severity of internal carotid artery disease as assessed by duplex scanning with spectral analysis of the Doppler signal and real-time B-mode imaging at the level of the carotid bifurcation. We found an inverse linear relation between light-to-moderate alcohol intake (less than or equal to 4 standard drinks/day) and severity of internal carotid artery stenosis. No conclusion could be drawn for heavier drinkers because there were too few. A logistic regression model showed that hypertension, cigarette smoking, and age in men and diabetes mellitus and cigarette smoking in women strongly counterbalanced the potential benefit of alcohol consumption. Although regular alcohol drinking cannot be advocated on the basis of our findings, light-to-moderate consumption of alcohol is the first factor to be inversely associated with extracranial carotid atherosclerosis in symptomatic patients with cerebrovascular disease.}

The patients entered into the UK Prospective Diabetes Study were aged between 25 and 65 (mean age 52 yr) and 33% had either an abnormal ECG or retinopathy. Different macrovascular complications such as strokes, heart attacks or abnormal ECG, and peripheral vascular disease showed little association one with another, and each was associated predominantly with different risk factors, e.g., strokes with hypertension, heart attacks with hypertriglyceridaemia and peripheral vascular disease with smoking and a low HDL cholesterol. Retinopathy was associated with reduced vibration perception but not with other complications. Reduced vibration perception and absent reflexes were associated with absent foot pulses and ischaemic skin changes, raising the possibility of a macrovascular, as well as microvascular, contribution to peripheral neuropathy. Microalbuminuria was associated with hypertension, which might be a factor predisposing to renal microvascular disease or be a consequence of it. Microalbuminuria was also associated with an abnormal ECG. Retinopathy, with exudates and or haemorrhages rather than just microaneurysms, was associated with hyperglycaemia. The occurrence of a particular complication in a diabetic patient is probably dependent on a combination of specific risk factors, many of which are related to, and probably affected by, potentially avoidable factors such as hyperglycaemia, obesity, smoking and hypertension.}

To assess whether or not early and late mortality after AMI is greater in women, 2,089 patients (1,551 men, 538 women) were followed for 1 year after AMI. In the hospital, women had an increased mortality compared to men (17.5 vs 12.3%, p less than 0.003) and were on average 7 years older, whereas after hospital discharge and up to 1 year no difference in mortality was observed. Multivariate analyses of historical, clinical and laboratory features demonstrated that gender had no independent predictive value when variables that included age, congestive heart failure in the hospital, history of congestive failure, prior AMI and diabetes mellitus were considered. Moreover, when age stratification was performed, the significant difference of in-hospital mortality between genders was no longer present. Causes of death in the hospital and during 1 year after hospital discharge were similar between men and women, whether or not age stratification was performed. Several baseline clinical characteristics were different between men and women; a history of systemic hypertension and congestive heart failure occurred more frequently in women and previous AMI and smoking occurred more commonly in men. Also, the value of several other important prognostic indicators after AMI, such as the ejection fraction, was found to differ between men and women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

To test for such an association among women, we examined the incidence of stroke in relation to cigarette smoking in a prospective cohort study of 118,539 women 30 to 55 years of age and free from coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer in 1976. During eight years of follow-up (908,447 person-years), we identified 274 strokes, comprising 71 subarachnoid hemorrhages, 26 intracerebral hemorrhages, 122 thromboembolic strokes, and 55 strokes about which information was insufficient to permit classification. The number of cigarettes smoked per day was associated positively with the risk of stroke. Compared with the women who had never smoked, those who smoked 1 to 14 cigarettes per day had an age-adjusted relative risk of 2.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.3), whereas those who smoked 25 or more cigarettes per day had a relative risk of 3.7 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 5.1). For women in this latter group, the relative risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was 9.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 5.3 to 17.9), as compared with those who had never smoked. Adjustment for the effects of relative weight, hypertension, diabetes, history of high cholesterol, previous use of oral contraceptives, postmenopausal estrogen therapy, and alcohol intake did not appreciably alter the association between cigarette use and incidence of stroke. These prospective data support a strong causal relation between cigarette smoking and stroke among young and middle-aged women.}

Blood pressure and plasma glucose levels were higher and smoking was more frequent in patients with occlusion than in those with stenosis. These points suggest that progression is related to some of the precursors of atherosclerosis. No difference was found between the patients with ICA disease and an age- and sex-matched group who had coronary disease without carotid disease, except for diabetes, which was more frequent in ICA occlusion, and for family history, which corresponded to the site of atherosclerosis (carotid vs coronary).

Twenty percent (10/50) of the stroke/TIA group were previously known to have abnormal glucose tolerance or diabetes; when this subgroup was excluded, there remained 42% of the original group (21/50) with abnormal GHb (greater than 10% A1) not previously known to have hyperglycemia, and the difference between GHb values for the stroke/TIA patients not known to have glycemic abnormality and for the hospital control group remained significant (p less than 0.005). Sixty-two percent of stroke/TIA patients (31/50) were under treatment for glycemic abnormality, or had high GHb, or both. The high prevalence of elevated GHb in this population could not be attributed to a relationship to age, sex, smoking history, hypercholesterolemia, or hypertension. We conclude that hyperglycemia commonly precedes stroke and TIA, is usually unrecognized, and has been under-appreciated as a risk factor for cerebrovascular disease.}

No satisfactory explanation for Yerushalmy's results has been given other than that low birth weight appears to relate more to the smoker than to the smoking. Recent studies by Silverman support this position. The possibility that nicotine may induce a physiologic response that serves to alleviate bioenergetic deficiency in some individuals should not be overlooked. In this view, both smoking and low birth weight are symptoms of deficient maternal bioenergetic systems. The literature is reviewed in terms of 4 questions of importance to the issue of maternal smoking--infant birth weight and health studies: 1) inference of causality from correlation; 2) the constitutional hypothesis; 3) maternal and fetal constitutional factors associated with low birth weight and perinatal death; and 4) environmental factors associated with low birth weight and perinatal death. Only a few maternal smoking-infant health studies used the invalid method of inference of causality from correlation. There is an underlying biological rationale supporting the constitutional hypothesis that appears to explain lower mean birth weights of children of women who smoke, compared with birth weights of children of nonsmokers. Examination of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke findings shows the following maternal constitutional factors, on the average, among those delivered of infants with low birth weights: low prepregnant weight, shortness of stature, and, tentatively, hyperthyroidism. Maternal factors associated with elevated perinatal mortality rates include diabetes mellitus, higher prepregnant weight ranges and taller maternal heights, advanced maternal age, low maternal age, birth weight of less than 2501 grams for last prior child, and male sex of infant. Environmental factors associated with low birth weight and detrimental health characteristics include elevated levels of carbon monoxide and ionization radiation, low socioeconomic index of the family, alcohol consumption, and high altitude. As yet there has not been a definitive analysis of the relationship between maternal smoking and low birth weight and perinatal death that simultaneously considers constitutional factors such as maternal height and weight and other factors such as parity and birthweight of less than 2500 grams for a preceding child.}

Also, data were obtained from death certificates, autopsy reports and long-term hospital records. A total of 606 ascertained cases (410 infarction, 137 hemorrhage, and 59 undetermined type) were matched for age, sex, residence and year of admission with 606 controls from admissions for other than cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders. The data were analyzed for elucidating the possible risk factors for infarction (INF) and hemorrhage (HGE). The findings suggested that hypertension was the main risk factor in hemorrhage, whereas in infarction, along with hypertension, other factors such as diabetes, heart enlargement in chest x-ray, ECG abnormalities, and smoking were suggested as risk factors. There was an association also between infarction, on one hand, and the history of receiving anticoagulants, diuretics, and medications for the heart, and the occurrence of myocardial infarction, on the other hand. These features indicate that infarction and ischemic heart disease have similar risk factors. Hemoglobin and hematocrit were higher in infarction cases than in their controls only when measured at stroke admission. No difference was revealed when they were measured prior to stroke. Their association with infraction therefore may be secondary to other factors and of no significance for its risk.}

We aim to describe the characteristics and evolution of cerebral aneurysms in a large cohort of ALWH. A chart review was completed for all adults evaluated at an urban, safety-net U.S. hospital between January 1, 2000, and October 22, 2021, with history of both HIV and at least one cerebral aneurysm. A total of 82 cerebral aneurysms were identified amongst 50 patients (52% female sex). Forty-six percent of patients with a nadir CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3 (N=13) and 44% of patients with maximum viral load >10,000 copies/mL (N=18) developed new aneurysms or were found to have aneurysm growth over time compared with 29% of patients with a CD4 nadir above 200 cells/mm3 (N=21) and 22% of patients with maximum viral load </= 75 copies/mL (N=9). New aneurysms were found, or existing aneurysms grew in 67% of those not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at time of aneurysm diagnosis (N=6), 38% of those with inconsistent ART use (N=8), and 21% of those with consistent ART (N=19). Among ALWH, lower CD4 nadir, higher zenith viral load, and inconsistent ART use may contribute to aneurysm formation or growth. Further studies are needed to more thoroughly characterize the association between immunologic status and cerebral aneurysm formation.}

  abstract = {Stroke is the second leading cause of death above the age of 60 years, and the fifth leading cause in people aged 15 to 59 years old as reported by the World Health Organization global burden of diseases. Stroke in the young is particularly tragic because of the potential to create long-term disability, burden on the victims, their families, and the community at large. Despite this, there is limited data on stroke in young adults, and its risk factors in Uganda. Therefore, we determined the frequency and risk factors for stroke among young adults at Mulago hospital. A case control study was conducted among patients presenting consecutively to the general medical wards with stroke during the study period September 2015 to March 2016. A brain Computerized Tomography scan was performed to confirm stroke and classify the stroke subtype. Controls were patients that presented to the surgical outpatient clinic with minor surgical conditions, matched for age and sex. Social demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics were assessed for both cases and controls. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviation were used to describe the social demographics of case and controls as well as the stroke types for cases. To determine risk factors for stroke, a conditional logistic regression, which accounts for matching (e.g., age and sex), was applied. Odds ratio (with 95% confidence interval) was used as a measure for associations. Among 51 patients with stroke, 39(76.5%) had ischemic stroke and 12(23.5%) had hemorrhagic stroke. The mean age was 36.8 years (SD 7.4) for stroke patients (cases) and 36.8 years (SD 6.9) for controls. Female patients predominated in both groups 56.9% in cases and 52.9% in controls. Risk factors noted were HIV infection, OR 3.57 (95% CI 1.16-10.96), elevated waist to hip ratio, OR 11.59(95% CI 1.98-68.24) and sickle cell disease, OR 4.68 (95% CI 1.11-19.70). This study found a protective effect of oral contraceptive use for stroke OR 0.27 95% CI 0.08-0.87. There was no association between stroke and hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Among young adults with stroke, ischemic stroke predominated over hemorrhagic stroke. Risk factors for stroke were HIV infection, elevated waist to hip ratio and sickle cell disease.}

We aimed to determine if stroke risk factors differed by HIV serostatus in Uganda. We conducted a matched cohort study, enrolling persons living with HIV (PWH) with acute stroke, matched by sex and stroke type to HIV uninfected (HIV-) individuals. We collected data on stroke risk factors and fitted logistic regression models for analysis. We enrolled 262 participants:105 PWH and 157 HIV-. The median ART duration was 5 years, and the median CD4 cell count was 214 cells/uL. PWH with ischemic stroke had higher odds of hypertriglyceridemia (AOR 1.63; 95% CI 1.04, 2.55, p=0.03), alcohol consumption (AOR 2.84; 95% CI 1.32, 6.14, p=0.008), and depression (AOR 5.64; 95%CI 1.32, 24.02, p=0.02) while HIV- persons with ischemic stroke were more likely to be > 55 years of age (AOR 0.43; 95%CI 0.20-0.95, p=0.037), have an irregular heart rhythm (AOR 0.31; 95%CI 0.10-0.98, p=0.047) and report low fruit consumption (AOR 0.39; 95%CI 0.18-0.83, p=0.014).  Among all participants with hemorrhagic stroke (n=78) we found no differences in the prevalence of risk factors between PWH and HIV-. PWH with ischemic stroke in Uganda present at a younger age, and with a combination of traditional and psychosocial risk factors. By contrast, HIV- persons more commonly present with arrhythmia. A differential approach to stroke prevention might be needed in these populations.}

  abstract = {Documentation of patterns and long-term trends in mortality in young people, which reflect huge changes in demographic and social determinants of adolescent health, enables identification of global investment priorities for this age group. We aimed to analyse data on the number of deaths, years of life lost, and mortality rates by sex and age group in people aged 10-24 years in 204 countries and territories from 1950 to 2019 by use of estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019. We report trends in estimated total numbers of deaths and mortality rate per 100 000 population in young people aged 10-24 years by age group (10-14 years, 15-19 years, and 20-24 years) and sex in 204 countries and territories between 1950 and 2019 for all causes, and between 1980 and 2019 by cause of death. We analyse variation in outcomes by region, age group, and sex, and compare annual rate of change in mortality in young people aged 10-24 years with that in children aged 0-9 years from 1990 to 2019. We then analyse the association between mortality in people aged 10-24 years and socioeconomic development using the GBD Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite measure based on average national educational attainment in people older than 15 years, total fertility rate in people younger than 25 years, and income per capita. We assess the association between SDI and all-cause mortality in 2019, and analyse the ratio of observed to expected mortality by SDI using the most recent available data release (2017). In 2019 there were 1·49 million deaths (95% uncertainty interval 1·39-1·59) worldwide in people aged 10-24 years, of which 61% occurred in males. 32·7% of all adolescent deaths were due to transport injuries, unintentional injuries, or interpersonal violence and conflict; 32·1% were due to communicable, nutritional, or maternal causes; 27·0% were due to non-communicable diseases; and 8·2% were due to self-harm. Since 1950, deaths in this age group decreased by 30·0% in females and 15·3% in males, and sex-based differences in mortality rate have widened in most regions of the world. Geographical variation has also increased, particularly in people aged 10-14 years. Since 1980, communicable and maternal causes of death have decreased sharply as a proportion of total deaths in most GBD super-regions, but remain some of the most common causes in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, where more than half of all adolescent deaths occur. Annual percentage decrease in all-cause mortality rate since 1990 in adolescents aged 15-19 years was 1·3% in males and 1·6% in females, almost half that of males aged 1-4 years (2·4%), and around a third less than in females aged 1-4 years (2·5%). The proportion of global deaths in people aged 0-24 years that occurred in people aged 10-24 years more than doubled between 1950 and 2019, from 9·5% to 21·6%. Variation in adolescent mortality between countries and by sex is widening, driven by poor progress in reducing deaths in males and older adolescents. Improving global adolescent mortality will require action to address the specific vulnerabilities of this age group, which are being overlooked. Furthermore, indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to jeopardise efforts to improve health outcomes including mortality in young people aged 10-24 years. There is an urgent need to respond to the changing global burden of adolescent mortality, address inequities where they occur, and improve the availability and quality of primary mortality data in this age group.

HIV is also a chronic inflammatory disorder associated with cardiovascular complications, yet the epidemiology of patients affected by both diseases is poorly understood. Utilizing the Uganda National RHD Registry, we described the echocardiographic findings, clinical characteristics, medication prescription rates, and outcomes of all 73 people carrying concurrent diagnoses of HIV and RHD between 2009 and 2018. These individuals were compared to an age- and sex-matched cohort of 365 subjects with RHD only. The median age of the HIV-RHD group was 36 years (interquartile range [IQR] 15), and 86% were women. The HIV-RHD cohort had higher rates of prior stroke/transient ischemic attack (12% vs 5%, P = .02) than the RHD-only group, with this association persisting following multivariable adjustment (odds ratio [OR] 3.08, P = .03). Prevalence of other comorbidities, echocardiographic findings, prophylactic penicillin prescription rates, retention in clinical care, and mortality were similar between the 2 groups. Patients living with RHD and HIV in Uganda are a relatively young, predominantly female group. Although RHD-HIV comorbid individuals have higher rates of stroke, their similar all-cause mortality and RHD care quality metrics (such as retention in care) compared to those with RHD alone suggest rheumatic heart disease defines their clinical outcome more than HIV does. We believe this study to be one of the first reports of the epidemiologic profile and longitudinal outcomes of patients who carry diagnoses of both conditions.}

Data from 43 HIV-negative patients with ANS and 59 HIV-negative patients with SNS were retrospectively collected from our hospital between December 2012 and December 2018. Compared with the ANS group, SNS group had more patients that were male, age≥45 years, had brain MRI abnormalities, and exhibited higher serum/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) TRUST titer, CSF WBC count, CSF protein concentration (P < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that male sex, age ≥45 years and CSF TRUST titer were risk factors for SNS [odds ratio (OR) = 7.946,P = 0.001;OR = 3.757, P = 0.041; OR = 2.713, P = 0.002; respectively]. The brain MRI findings of 78 patients without comorbidities showed that ischemic infarct lesions presented in 17/37 (45.95%) of patients with ANS; infarct ischemic stroke (73.17%) especially multiple cerebral infractions (46.34%), cerebral atrophy (48.78%) were also common presentations in the SNS group. Patients with HIV-negative ANS and SNS presented different clinical, laboratory and brain MRI features. Male sex, age ≥45 years and elevated CSF TRUST titer may have an increased risk of developing neurological symptoms. Brain MRI abnormalities may present prior to clinical symptoms. Multiple cerebral infarctions without explained reasons or cerebral atrophy should alert clinicians the possibility of SNS.}

The Special Report discusses the challenges of providing equitable health care for people with dementia in the United States. An estimated 6.2 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia today. This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060 barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent, slow or cure AD. Official death certificates recorded 121,499 deaths from AD in 2019, the latest year for which data are available, making Alzheimer's the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth-leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2019, deaths from stroke, heart disease and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths from AD increased more than 145%. This trajectory of deaths from AD was likely exacerbated in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 11 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 15.3 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2020. These figures reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a decade earlier, as well as an increase in the amount of care provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving was valued at $256.7 billion in 2020. Its costs, however, extend to family caregivers' increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes - costs that have been aggravated by COVID-19. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are more than three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 23 times as great. Total payments in 2021 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be $355 billion. Despite years of efforts to make health care more equitable in the United States, racial and ethnic disparities remain - both in terms of health disparities, which involve differences in the burden of illness, and health care disparities, which involve differences in the ability to use health care services. Blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans continue to have a higher burden of illness and lower access to health care compared with Whites. Such disparities, which have become more apparent during COVID-19, extend to dementia care. Surveys commissioned by the Alzheimer's Association recently shed new light on the role of discrimination in dementia care, the varying levels of trust between racial and ethnic groups in medical research, and the differences between groups in their levels of concern about and awareness of Alzheimer's disease. These findings emphasize the need to increase racial and ethnic diversity in both the dementia care workforce and in Alzheimer's clinical trials.}

A prospective study enrolling consecutive adults presenting to MRRH with abrupt onset of focal neurologic deficits suspicious for stroke, from August 2014 to March 2015. All patients had head computed tomography (CT) confirmation of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Data was collected on mortality, morbidity, risk factors, and imaging characteristics. Investigators screened 134 potential subjects and enrolled 108 patients. Sixty-two percent had ischemic and 38% hemorrhagic stroke. The mean age of all patients was 62.5 (SD 17.4), and 52% were female. More patients had hypertension in the hemorrhagic stroke group than in the ischemic stroke group (53% vs. 32%, p = 0.0376). Thirty-day mortality was 38.1% (p = 0.0472), and significant risk factors were National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, female sex, anemia, and HIV infection. A one unit increase of the NIHSS on admission increased the risk of death at 30 days by 6%. Patients with hemorrhagic stroke had statistically higher NIHSS scores (p = 0.0408) on admission compared to patients with ischemic stroke, and also had statistically higher Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at discharge (p = 0.0063), and mRS score change from baseline (p = 0.04). Our study highlights an overall 30-day stroke mortality of 38.1% in southwestern Uganda, and identifies NIHSS at admission, female sex, anemia, and HIV infection as predictors of mortality.}

The pathological changes were graded blinded to the HIV status and a second histopathologist reassessed 15%. Univariable models were used for statistical analyses; p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Nineteen HIV-positive post-mortem cases fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Nineteen HIV-negative controls were selected. We assessed mostly small-medium-sized vessels. For inflammation (CD45), 7 (36%) of the HIV+ had moderate/severe changes compared with none for the HIV- group (p < 0.001). Moderate/severe increase in smooth muscle remodeling (SMA) was found in 8 (42%) HIV+ and 0 HIV- brains (p < 0.001). Moderate/severe lipoprotein deposition (LOX-1) was found in 3 (15%) and 0 HIV-brains (p < 0.001). ART was associated with less inflammation [5 (63%) no ART versus 2 (18%) on ART (p = 0.028)] but was not associated with reduced lipid deposition or smooth muscle damage. In HIV infection, there are pre-clinical small- to medium-sized vessel atherosclerotic changes and ART may have limited impact on these changes. This could have implications on the increasing burden of cerebrovascular disease in HIV populations and warrants further investigation.}

  abstract = {Stroke is a heterogeneous disease in persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV is thought to increase the risk of stroke through both HIV-related and traditional stroke risk factors, which vary with respect to the patient's age and clinical characteristics. Numerous studies show that detectable viremia and immunosuppression increase the risk of stroke across all ages, whereas traditional risk factors are more common in the aging population with HIV. As persons living with HIV age and acquire traditional stroke risk factors, the prevalence of stroke will likely continue to increase. Large- and small-vessel disease are the most common causes of stroke, although it is important to evaluate for infectious etiology as well. Research regarding the management of stroke in patients with HIV is scant, and recommendations often parallel those for the general population. Treatment of HIV and effective reduction of traditional stroke risk factors is important to reduce the risk of stroke in persons living with HIV. Future research will help elucidate the pathophysiology of HIV and stroke risk, investigate sex differences in stroke risk, and evaluate the safety and benefits of standard stroke preventative measures and HIV-specific interventions in this population.}

Arterial spin-labeling is a technique to measure cerebral blood flow and is more sensitive than regional volume loss in assessing neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive aging. Previous studies have found global cerebral perfusion abnormalities in the HIV+ participants. In this study, we evaluated the specific regional pattern of CBF abnormalities in older HIV+ participants using quantitative whole-brain arterial spin-labeling. CBF data from the UCSF HIV Over 60 Cohort and the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were retrospectively evaluated to identify 19 HIV+ older adults, all with plasma viral suppression (including 5 with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder); 13 healthy, age-matched controls; and 19 participants with early mild cognitive impairment. CBF values were averaged by ROI and compared among the 3 groups using generalized linear models. When we accounted for age, education, sex, and vascular risk factors, the HIV+ participants demonstrated alterations in regional cerebral perfusion, including hypoperfusion of bilateral temporal, parietal, and occipital brain regions compared with both clinically healthy participants and those with mild cognitive impairment. Arterial spin-labeling showed reasonable test characteristics in distinguishing those with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder from healthy controls and participants with mild cognitive impairment. This study found specific CBF patterns associated with HIV status despite viral suppression-data that should animate further investigations into the pathobiologic basis of vascular and cognitive abnormalities in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders.}

We conducted a descriptive study of trends in mortality rates from major causes of death for females in the United States from 1900 through 2010. We analyzed all-cause unadjusted death rates (UDRs) for males and females and for white and nonwhite males and females from 1900 through 2010. Data for blacks, distinct from other nonwhites, were available beginning in 1970 and are reported for this and following decades. We also computed age-adjusted all-cause death rates (AADRs) by the direct method using age-specific death rates and the 2000 US standard population. Data for the analysis of decadal trends in mortality rates were obtained from yearly tabulations of causes of death from published compilations and from public use computer data files. In 1900, UDRs and AADRs were higher for nonwhites than whites and decreased more rapidly for nonwhite females than for white females. Reductions were highest among younger females and lowest among older females. Rates for infectious diseases decreased the most. AADRs for heart disease increased 96.5% in the first 5 decades, then declined by 70.6%. AADRs for cancer rose, then decreased. Stroke decreased steadily. Unintentional motor vehicle injury AADRs increased, leveled off, then decreased. Differences between white and nonwhite female all-cause AADRs almost disappeared during the study period (5.4 per 100,000); differences in white and black AADRs remained high (121.7 per 100,000). Improvements in social and environmental determinants of health probably account for decreased mortality rates among females in the early 20th century, partially offset by increased smoking. In the second half of the century, other public health and clinical measures contributed to reductions. The persistent prevalence of risk behaviors and underuse of preventive and medical services indicate opportunities for increased female longevity, particularly in racial minority populations.}

Women (n = 12,955) were generally at lower CVD risk than men (n = 36,094). Overall, initiation rates of CVD interventions were lower in women than men; LLDs: incidence rate 1.28 [1.21, 1.35] vs. 2.40 [2.34, 2.46]; ACEIs: 0.88 [0.82, 0.93] vs. 1.43 [1.39, 1.48]; anti-hypertensives: 1.40 [1.33, 1.47] vs. 1.72 [1.68, 1.77] and ICPs: 0.08 [0.06, 0.10] vs. 0.30 [0.28, 0.32], and this was also true for most CVD interventions when exclusively considering periods of follow-up for which individuals were at high CVD risk. In fully adjusted models, women were less likely to receive CVD interventions than men (LLDs: relative rate 0.83 [0.78, 0.88]; ACEIs: 0.93 [0.86, 1.01]; ICPs: 0.54 [0.43, 0.68]), except for the receipt of anti-hypertensives (1.17 [1.10, 1.25]). The use of most CVD interventions was lower among women than men. Interventions are needed to ensure that all HIV-positive persons, particularly women, are appropriately monitored for CVD and, if required, receive appropriate CVD interventions.}

Among people living with HIV (PLWHIV), the risk of vascular events is increased; however, whether incidental carotid plaque is increased and there is an association between incidental carotid plaque, plaque characteristics, and vascular events among PLWHIV is unclear. Data from the multi-institutional Research Patient Data Registry were used. Presence and characteristics (high-risk plaque, including spotty calcification and low attenuation) of carotid plaque by computerized tomography among PLWHIV without known vascular disease were described. Data were compared with uninfected controls similar in age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and cigarette smoking to cases. Primary outcome was an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event, and secondary outcome was ischemic stroke. Cohort consisted of 209 PLWHIV (45±10 years, 72% male) and 168 controls. Using computerized tomography, PLWHIV without vascular disease had higher rates of any carotid plaque (34% versus 25%; P=0.04), noncalcified (18% versus 5%; P<0.001) and high-risk plaque (25% versus 16%; P=0.03). Over a follow-up of 3 years, 19 atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events (9 strokes) occurred. Carotid plaque was independently associated with a 3-fold increase in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events among PLWHIV (hazard ratio, 2.91; confidence interval, 1.10-7.7, P=0.03) and a 4-fold increased risk of stroke (hazard ratio, 4.43; confidence interval, 1.17-16.70; P=0.02); high-risk plaque was associated with a 3-fold increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events and a 4-fold increased risk of stroke. There is an increase in incidental carotid plaque, noncalcified plaque, and high-risk plaque among PLWHIV, and the presence and characteristics of carotid plaque are associated with subsequent vascular events.}

  abstract = {With potent antiretroviral drugs, HIV infection is becoming a chronic disease. Emergence of comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become a leading concern for patients living with the infection. We hypothesized that the chronic and persistent inflammation and immune activation associated with HIV disease leads to accelerated aging, characterized by CVD. This will translate into higher incidence rates of CVD in HIV infected participants, when compared to HIV negative participants, after adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors. When characterized further using cardiovascular imaging, biomarkers, immunological and genetic profiles, CVD associated with HIV will show different characteristics compared to CVD in HIV-negative individuals. The Canadian HIV and Aging cohort is a prospective, controlled cohort study funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. It will recruit patients living with HIV who are aged 40 years or older or have lived with HIV for 15 years or more. A control population, frequency matched for age, sex, and smoking status, will be recruited from the general population. Patients will attend study visits at baseline, year 1, 2, 5 and 8. At each study visit, data on complete medical and pharmaceutical history will be captured, along with anthropometric measures, a complete physical examination, routine blood tests and electrocardiogram. Consenting participants will also contribute blood samples to a research biobank. The primary outcome is incidence of a composite of: myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, stroke, hospitalization for angina or congestive heart failure, revascularization or amputation for peripheral artery disease, or cardiovascular death. Preplanned secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality, incidence of the metabolic syndrome, incidence of type 2 diabetes, incidence of renal failure, incidence of abnormal bone mineral density and body fat distribution. Patients participating to the cohort will be eligible to be enrolled in four pre-planned sub-studies of cardiovascular imaging, glucose metabolism, immunological and genetic risk profile. The Canadian HIV and Aging Cohort will provide insights on pathophysiological pathways leading to premature CVD for patients living with HIV.}

We examined the impact of HIV on inpatient mortality, length of acute hospital stay and complications (pneumonia, respiratory failure, sepsis and convulsions), in hospitalized strokes in Thailand. All hospitalized strokes between 1 October 2004 and 31 January 2013 were included. Data were obtained from a National Insurance Database. Characteristics and outcomes for non-HIV and HIV patients were compared and multivariate logistic and linear regression models were constructed to assess the above outcomes. Of 610 688 patients (mean age 63·4 years, 45·4% female), 0·14% (866) had HIV infection. HIV patients were younger, a higher proportion were male and had higher prevalence of anaemia (P < 0·001) compared to non-HIV patients. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension and diabetes, were more common in the non-HIV group (P < 0·001). After adjusting for age, sex, stroke type and co-morbidities, HIV infection was significantly associated with higher odds of sepsis [odds ratio (OR) 1·75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·29-2·4], and inpatient mortality (OR 2·15, 95% CI 1·8-2·56) compared to patients without HIV infection. The latter did not attenuate after controlling for complications (OR 2·20, 95% CI 1·83-2·64). HIV infection is associated with increased odds of sepsis and inpatient mortality after acute stroke.}

Cardiovascular disease represents the most prevalent cause of admissions to the medical service of the University Hospital of the State of Haiti. No previous study has examined the demographics of congestive heart failure in urban Haiti. Two hundred forty-seven patients presented to the inpatient service between May 2011 and May 2013. Evaluation included history and physical, CBC, renal/metabolic profile, serum glucose, anti-HIV antibody, ECG, chest radiograph and echocardiogram. Treatment included angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, furosemide and spironolactone, carvedilol, digoxin and anticoagulation. Women (62.4%) outnumbered men; patients were relatively young (mean age 50.1) and from the lowest socio-economic levels of the population. Nearly all (98.8%) presented with NYHA III-IV status, with correspondingly high mortality (23.3%). Echocardiography showed 73% dilated cardiomyopathy; 83% showed moderate to severe LV systolic dysfunction (mean EF 36.5 +/- 15%) and 17% preserved LV systolic function. The three principal etiologies were dilated cardiomyopathy (29%) hypertensive cardiomyopathy (27%) and peripartum cardiomyopathy (20%). Ischemic cardiomyopathy was rare (3.4%). At 27 months follow-up, 76.7% of the patients were alive and well. Among those who died, mean survival time was 113 days. Readmission carried a poor prognosis. This congestive heart failure study from Haiti shows an unusually high proportion of young women, primarily due to peripartum cardiomyopathy. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is rare, as in Africa. Further study is warranted to address the particular problem of the high frequency of peripartum cardiomyopathy in this population.}

We performed a retrospective cohort study of the HIV-infected patients residing in the Local Health Authority of Brescia, northern Italy, from 2000 to 2012. Incidence of CVEs events in HIV-positive patients was compared with that expected in general population living in the same area, computing standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). CVEs-associated risk factors were assessed using Cox regression analysis and competing risk model of death. About 3766 HIV-infected patients were included in the study. Over the 12-year-period, we recorded 134 CVEs: 83 (61.9%) acute myocardial infarctions (CVE type-1), and 51 (38.1%) strokes (CVE type-2). A twofold increased risk (SIR = 2.02) of CVEs was found in HIV-infected patients compared to the general population. Notably, within male patients: for CVE type-1, SIR = 1.89, for CVE type-2 SIR = 2.25; within female patients: for CVE type-1, SIR = 2.91, for CVE type-2 SIR = 2.07. Age >45 years, male gender, diabetes, and total blood cholesterol >200 mg/dl were significantly associated with CVEs incidence (for all, p < .05). These results were confirmed using the competing risk model. Our cohort study confirmed the higher incidence of CVEs in HIV-positive patients, and put emphasis on the importance of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Overall CVE risk in HIV-positive patients was twice as high as CVE risk in general population. We found a peculiar gender distribution, with a relative risk for CVE type-1 higher in HIV-positive females, and a higher CVE type-2 risk in male patients. More studies are needed in order to support these findings and to further highlight possible gender differences in the risk of developing CVEs in HIV-positive patients.}

Standardized morbidity ratio for age and sex (SMR) were used to compare FOT to mainland France. Compared with mainland France, people living in the four FOT had high SMR for diabetes care (Guadeloupe 1.9; Martinique 1.7; Guyane 1.9; La Réunion 2.3), dialysis (2.7; 2.4; 3.8; 4.4), stroke (1.2; 1.1; 2.0; 1.5), and hospitalization for infectious diseases (1.9; 2.5; 2.4; 1.4) and obstetrics (1.4; 1.2; 1.9; 1.2). Care for inflammatory bowel disease or cancer were less frequent except for prostate in Martinique and Guadeloupe (2.3). People living in Martinique, Guadeloupe and la Reunion had more frequently care for psychotic disorders (2.0; 1.7; 1.2), dementia (1.1; 1.3; 11), epileptic seizures (1.4; 1.4; 16) and hospitalizations for burns (2.6; 1.7; 2.9). In la Reunion, people had more frequently coronary syndrome (1.3), cardiac heart failure (1.6), chronic respiratory diseases except cystic fibrosis (1.5), drug addiction (1.4) and hospitalizations for cardiovascular catheterization (1.4) and toxicology, poisoning, alcohol (1.7). Other differences were observed by gender: HIV infection, peripheral arterial disease, some chronic inflammatory disease (lupus) were more frequent in women living in Martinique or Guadeloupe, compared to women from mainland France and psychotic disorders for men. From la Reunion, men had more frequently liver and pancreatic diseases and hospitalisation for toxicology, poisoning, alcohol than men from mainland France. This study highlights the utility of administrative database to compare and follow population health status considering healthcare use. Specific Public Health policies are justified for FOT, taking into account the specific context of each FOT, the necessity of prevention initiatives and screening to reduce the frequency of the chronic diseases.}

Analysis of a large nationally representative sample shows evidence that users of health-related information (users) on the Internet are younger, more educated, more likely to be insured, more likely to be female, and less likely to be African American. After adjusting for demographic differences, users are more likely to have been diagnosed with hypertension, cancer, stroke, and high cholesterol, but no evidence of current hypertension, weight-related issues, or being in fair or poor health. Users are less likely to smoke and among smokers are more likely to attempt quitting. Users are more likely to exercise, get a flu shot, pap smear, mammogram, HIV test, colon cancer screening, blood pressure check, and cholesterol check, but likely to be heavy drinkers. With few exceptions, results appear robust across gender, age groups, level of education, and ethnicity. Use is generally positively associated with prior diagnosis for several conditions and behaviors related to improved health, but I find no relationship with existing health status. The association between use of health-related Internet information and health-related behavior seems robust across levels of education, age, gender, and race.}

Control of hypertension is associated with a larger reduction in morbidity and mortality in younger populations compared with the elderly; however, blood pressure control efforts in the young are hampered by scarcity of data on prevalence and factors influencing awareness, treatment and control of hypertension. We aimed to describe the prevalence of prehypertension and hypertension among young adults in a peri-urban district of Uganda and the factors associated with occurrence of hypertension in this population. This cross-sectional study was conducted between August, 2012 and May 2013 in Wakiso district, a suburban district that that encircles Kampala, Uganda's capital city. We collected data on socio-demographic characteristics and hypertension status using a modified STEPs questionnaire from 3685 subjects aged 18-40 years selected by multistage cluster sampling. Blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were performed using standardized protocols. Fasting blood sugar and HIV status were determined using a venous blood sample. Association between hypertension status and various biosocial factors was assessed using logistic regression. The overall prevalence of hypertension was 15% (95% CI 14.2 - 19.6) and 40% were pre-hypertensive. Among the 553 hypertensive participants, 76 (13.7%) were aware of their diagnosis and all these participants had initiated therapy with target blood pressure control attained in 20% of treated subjects. Hypertension was significantly associated with the older age-group, male sex and obesity. There was a significantly lower prevalence of hypertension among participants with HIV OR 0.6 (95% CI 0.4-0.8, P = 0.007). There is a high prevalence of high blood pressure in this young periurban population of Uganda with sub-optimal diagnosis and control. There is previously undocumented high rate of treatment, a unique finding that may be exploited to drive efforts to control hypertension. Specific programs for early diagnosis and treatment of hypertension among the young should be developed to improve control of hypertension. The relationship between HIV infection and blood pressure requires further clarification by longitudinal studies.}

We explored sex- and age-specific patterns of causes of deaths in a rural demographic surveillance site in northern KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa over the period 2000-2011. Deaths reported through the demographic surveillance were followed up by a verbal autopsy (VA) interview using a standardised questionnaire. Causes of death were assigned likelihoods using the publicly available tool InterVA-4. Cause-specific mortality fractions were determined by age and sex. Over the study period, a total of 5,416 (47%) and 6,081 (53%) deaths were recorded in men and women, respectively. Major causes of death proportionally affecting more women than men were (all p<0.0001): human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) (20.1% vs. 13.6%), other and unspecified cardiac disease (5.9% vs. 3.2%), stroke (4.5% vs. 2.7%), reproductive neoplasms (1.7% vs. 0.4%), diabetes (2.4% vs. 1.2%), and breast neoplasms (0.4% vs. 0%). Major causes of deaths proportionally affecting more men than women were (all p<0.0001) assault (6.1% vs. 1.7%), pulmonary tuberculosis (34.5% vs. 30.2%), road traffic accidents (3.0% vs. 1.0%), intentional self-harm (1.3% vs. 0.3%), and respiratory neoplasms (2.5% vs. 1.5%). Causes of death due to communicable diseases predominated in all age groups except in older persons. While mortality during the 2000s was dominated by tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, we found substantial sex-specific differences both for communicable and non-communicable causes of death, some which can be explained by a differing sex-specific age structure. InterVA-4 is likely to be a valuable tool for investigating causes of death patterns in other similar Southern African settings.}

We included migrants who obtained residence permits in Denmark between 1 January 1993 and 31 December 2010 (n = 114,331). Occurrence of severe conditions was identified through linkage to the Danish National Patient Register. Hazard Ratios (HRs) were modelled for disease incidence by residence duration since arrival (0-5 years; 0-10 years; 0-18 years) adjusting for age and sex. Compared with Danish-born individuals, refugees and family reunited immigrants had lower HRs of stroke and breast cancer within 5 years after arrival; however, HRs increased at longer follow-up. For example, HRs of stroke among refugees increased from 0.77 (95% CI: 0.66; 0.91) to 0.96 (95% CI: 0.88; 1.05). For ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and diabetes, refugees and family reunited migrants had higher HRs within 5 years after arrival, and most HRs had increased by end of follow-up. For example, HRs of IHD among family reunited migrants increased from 1.29 (95% CI: 1.17; 1.42) to 1.43 (95% CI: 1.39; 1.52). In contrast, HRs for TB and HIV/AIDS showed a consistent decrease over time. Our analyses of the effect of duration of residence on disease occurrence among migrants imply that, when explaining migrants' advantageous health outcomes, the ruling theory of the HME should be used with caution, and other explanatory models should be included.}

Previously validated case definitions were used to identify persons with mental health disorders and any of the following physical chronic diseases: diabetes, congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension, asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, peripheral vascular disease and end-stage renal failure. We examined multimorbidity prevalence as the presence of at least two physical chronic conditions, or as combined physical-mental health multimorbidity. Direct age-sex standardized rates were calculated for both cohorts for comparison. 34.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 33.6% to 35.2%) of people with HIV had at least one other physical condition. Prevalence was especially high for mental health conditions (38.6%), hypertension (14.9%) and asthma (12.7%). After accounting for age and sex differences, people with HIV had significantly higher prevalence of all chronic conditions except myocardial infarction and hypertension, as well as substantially higher multimorbidity (prevalence ratio 1.30, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.44) and combined physical-mental health multimorbidity (1.79, 95% CI 1.65 to 1.94). Prevalence of multimorbidity among people with HIV increased with age. The difference in prevalence of multimorbidity between the two cohorts was more pronounced among women. People living with HIV in Ontario, especially women, had higher prevalence of comorbidity and multimorbidity than the general population. Quantifying this morbidity at the population level can help inform healthcare delivery requirements for this complex population.}

  abstract = {Little is known about the prevalence and predictors of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) of older adults in South Africa. This study aims to investigate the self-reported prevalences of major chronic NCDs and their predictors among older South Africans. We conducted a national population-based cross-sectional survey with a sample of 3,840 individuals aged 50 years or above in South Africa in 2008. The outcome variable was the self-reported presence of chronic NCDs suffered, namely, arthritis, stroke, angina, diabetes, chronic lung disease, asthma, depression, and hypertension. The exposure variables were sociodemographic characteristics: age, gender, education, wealth status, race, marital status, and residence. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine sociodemographic factors predictive of the presence of chronic NCDs. The prevalence of chronic NCDs was 51.8%. The prevalence of multimorbidity (≥2 chronic conditions) was 22.5%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that being female, being in age groups 60-79 and 70-79, being Coloured or Asian, having no schooling, having greater wealth, and residing in an urban area were associated with the presence of NCDs. The rising burden of chronic NCDs affecting older people places a heavy burden on the healthcare system as a result of increased demand and access to healthcare services. Concerted effort is needed to develop strategies for the prevention and management of NCDs, especially among economically disadvantaged individuals who need these services the most.}

  abstract = {The incidence of vascular events in HIV-infected individuals is increasing. We investigated whether there is a higher prevalence of vascular risk factors in the adult US population with HIV compared to uninfected controls that could explain some of the increased vascular events. We obtained prevalence estimates of vascular risk factors, stratified by the HIV status, in sampled adults aged 20-49 years from the 1999 to 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Estimates were weighted to account for oversampling and nonresponse. Logistic regression models with adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic status were created to adjust for confounders. The analysis included 12,339 US adults, 76 with HIV infection. The weighted seroprevalence of HIV was 0.48% (95% CI 0.33-0.65). In univariate analysis, HIV infection was more prevalent in non-Hispanic blacks (odds ratio [OR] 7.4, 95% CI 3.6-15.2), men (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.42-4.89), the physically inactive (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0-3.0), and current smokers (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.4). Increased waist circumference (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-1.0) was less common in HIV-infected individuals, although controlling for sex and ethnicity differences, this difference became nonsignificant (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.3-1.2). Further controlling for differences in income and education rendered the associations with smoking and physical inactivity nonsignificant, but revealed associations of HIV infection with hypertension (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.0-6.0) and diabetes (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.1-16.1). These results underscore the need to further investigate the role of cardiovascular risk factors in the growing HIV population.}

  abstract = {Patterns of morbidity and mortality among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals taking antiretroviral therapy are changing as a result of immune reconstitution and improved survival. We studied the influence of aging on the epidemiology of non-AIDS diseases in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. The Swiss HIV Cohort Study is a prospective observational cohort established in 1988 with continuous enrollment. We determined the incidence of clinical events (per 1000 person-years) from January 2008 (when a new questionnaire on non-AIDS-related morbidity was introduced) through December 2010. Differences across age groups were analyzed using Cox regression, adjusted for CD4 cell count, viral load, sex, injection drug use, smoking, and years of HIV infection. Overall, 8444 (96%) of 8848 participants contributed data from 40,720 semiannual visits; 2233 individuals (26.4%) were aged 50-64 years, and 450 (5.3%) were aged ≥65 years. The median duration of HIV infection was 15.4 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.59-22.0 years); 23.2% had prior clinical AIDS. We observed 994 incident non-AIDS events in the reference period: 201 cases of bacterial pneumonia, 55 myocardial infarctions, 39 strokes, 70 cases of diabetes mellitus, 123 trauma-associated fractures, 37 fractures without adequate trauma, and 115 non-AIDS malignancies. Multivariable hazard ratios for stroke (17.7; CI, 7.06-44.5), myocardial infarction (5.89; 95% CI, 2.17-16.0), diabetes mellitus (3.75; 95% CI, 1.80-7.85), bone fractures without adequate trauma (10.5; 95% CI, 3.58-30.5), osteoporosis (9.13; 95% CI, 4.10-20.3), and non-AIDS-defining malignancies (6.88; 95% CI, 3.89-12.2) were elevated for persons aged ≥65 years. Comorbidity and multimorbidity because of non-AIDS diseases, particularly diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, non-AIDS-defining malignancies, and osteoporosis, become more important in care of HIV-infected persons and increase with older age.}

The study was undertaken from February 1st to June 30th 2007, in three capitals cities in Senegal (one national, and two regional). It concerned the MSM that benefited from at least one of services of an MSM association. Studied variables included socio demographic characteristics, sexual practices, as well as knowledge and attitudes related to STDs and VIH/AIDS. Interviews took place during appointments obtained by direct phone call or by two MSM leaders intermediary. Data were seized and analyzed with Epi2000 Software. Among 245 registered MSM, 63 had a precise contact (address and/or phone number), and 49 aged in average of 25 years were investigated. Among them, one was illiterate, five studied Koran, seven Arab and 36 French. The socio-professional categories differentiated two officials, two merchants, one mechanic, one fighter, five artists, five restorers, seven tailors, 11 students, and 15 unemployed. The associations, to which 35 HSH belonged, were related to sexuality (66%), religion (20%), social matters (8%) and economy (6%). Sexual habits, according to anal intercourse, differentiated the "Ubbi" or receptive/passive (57%), the "Yoos" or incertif/active (25%), the "Ubbi/Yoos" who play the two roles (14%) and the "neitherUbbi/norYoos" who had other practices than anal (4%). Practices between men, concerned mutual strokes (100%), fellatio (61%) and anal intercourse (49%), counted 45% for remuneration, 35% of multi-unprotected partnership, and 12% of breaking condom. Practices with women were reported by 15 MSM (31%). Concerning STDs, at least one sign was reported by 43 MSM, one transmission way by 42, one mean of protection by 47; and the first recourse was a health system for 36 MSM. The test of HIV/AIDS screening was done by 38 HSH among which 30 withdrew the results. The "Ubby" adhered much more to associations, and practiced less unprotected vaginal intercourses and multi partnerships. Sexual relations between men, in Senegal, constitute a factor of propagation for STDs and HIV/AIDS. Beliefs, values, and popular reactions still limit the big principles (liberty, equality, solidarity, and participation) of preventive and curative care. Therefore, ethics and effectiveness must be conciliated to face more MSM needs, for a better health of the populations.}

We sought to compare coronary risk factors, angiographic features, acute results of percutaneous coronary intervention, in-hospital outcomes, and pre-specified 1 year prognosis of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients with ACS. HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients with a first episode of ACS were matched for age (±5 years), sex, and type of ACS. The primary endpoint was the rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MACCE), comprising cardiac death, recurrent ACS, recurrent coronary revascularization, and stroke. Overall, 103 HIV-infected and 195 HIV-uninfected patients were enrolled (mean age 49.0 ± 9.4 years, 94% men). Coronary risk factors were well balanced, but HIV-infected patients more frequently used illicit drugs (23 vs. 6%, P = 0.001) and had higher triglyceride concentrations (246 ± 189 vs. 170 ± 139 mg/dL, P = 0.002) compared with HIV-uninfected patients. Angiographic features of coronary artery disease were similar (multivessel disease 41 vs. 39%, P = 0.96; ACC/AHA type culprit lesion ≥B2, both 77%, P = 0.83). At 1 year, the rate of occurrence of first MACCE did not differ between groups [hazard ratio (HR) 1.4, 95% CI 0.6-3.0]. Recurrent ACS was more frequent in HIV-infected patients (HR 6.5, 95% CI 1.7-23.9) with no difference in the rate of clinical restenosis. These results suggest that the acute management of ACS in HIV-infected patients can routinely be the same as that of HIV-uninfected patients, but that specific secondary prevention measures are needed to alleviate the increased risk of recurrent ACS.}

  abstract = {In Thailand, 35% of all deaths occur in hospitals, and the cause of death is medically certified by attending physicians. About 15% of hospital deaths are registered with nonspecific diagnoses, despite the potential for greater accuracy using information available from medical records. Further, issues arising from transcription of diagnoses from Thai to English at registration create uncertainty about the accuracy of registration data even for specified causes of death. This paper reports findings from a study to measure validity of registered diagnoses in a sample of deaths that occurred in hospitals in Thailand during 2005. A sample of 4,644 hospital deaths was selected, and for each case, medical records were reviewed. A process of medical record abstraction, expert physician review, and independent adjudication for the selection and coding of underlying causes of death was used to derive reference diagnoses. Validation characteristics were computed for leading causes of hospital deaths from registration data, and misclassification patterns were identified for registration diagnoses. Study findings were used to estimate cause-specific mortality patterns for hospital deaths in Thailand. Adequate medical records were available for 3,316 deaths in the study sample. Losses to follow up were nondifferential by age, sex, and cause. Medical records review identified specific underlying causes for the majority of deaths that were originally assigned ill-defined causes as well as for those originally assigned to residual categories for specific cause groups. In comparison with registration data for the sample, we found an increase in the relative proportion of deaths in hospitals due to stroke, ischemic heart disease, transport accidents, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, liver diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Registration data on causes for deaths occurring in hospitals require periodic validation prior to their use for epidemiological research or public health policy. Procedures for death certification and coding of underlying causes of death need to be streamlined to improve reliability of registration data. Estimates of cause-specific mortality from this research will inform burden of disease estimation and guide interventions to reduce avoidable mortality in hospitals in Thailand.}

Logistic regression was used to determine the odds of comorbidities and predictors of mortality. We identified 5310 HCV-infected and 427 HCVHIV-coinfected subjects. The latter were younger, more likely to be male, black race, and had a lower body mass index. After adjusting for age, race, and sex we found that coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM) as primary cause of renal failure and cirrhosis were less frequently diagnosed in the HCVHIV-coinfected subjects, whereas hepatitis B, wasting, drug and alcohol abuse, and dependence were more frequently diagnosed.Increasing age, CAD, stroke, DM, cirrhosis, wasting, cancer,and drug abuse and dependence were associated with higher odds of death in the HCV monoinfected subjects, whereas cirrhosis, wasting, and smoking were the only such factors in the HCV-HIV-coinfected subjects. The frequency and patterns of comorbidities and predictors of death differ in HCV-monoinfected and HCVHIV-coinfected persons on dialysis. These differences should be taken into account when designing future interventions.}

  abstract = {Depression in the physically unwell is common and an important cause of morbidity. There are problems with diagnosing depression in the physically ill which may lead to under-recognition and under-treatment. In clinical practice antidepressants are available and a feasible option for treating depressive disorders. Therefore we thought it would be a reasonable first step in addressing this problem to describe the literature of randomised controlled trials in this area. To determine whether antidepressants are clinically effective and acceptable for the treatment of depression in people who also have a physical illness. MEDLINE, Cochrane Library Trials Register and Cochrane Depression and Neurosis Group Trials Register were all systematically searched, supplemented by hand searches of two journals and reference searching. All relevant randomised trials comparing any antidepressant drug (as defined in the British National Formulary) with placebo or no treatment, in patients of either sex over 16, who have been diagnosed as depressed by any criterion, and have a specified physical disorder (for example cancer, myocardial infarction). "Functional" disorders where there is no generally agreed physical pathology (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome) were excluded. The main outcome measures are numbers of individuals who recover/improve at the end of the trial and, as a proxy for treatment acceptability, numbers who complete treatment. Data was extracted independently by the reviewers onto data collection forms and differences settled by discussion. 18 studies were included, covering 838 patients with a range of physical diseases (cancer 2, diabetes 1, head injury 1, heart 1, HIV 5, lung 1, multiple sclerosis 1, renal 1, stroke 3, mixed 2). Depression was diagnosed clinically in 3 studies, otherwise by structured interview or checklist. Only 5 studies described how they performed randomisation. 1 study compared drug with no treatment, and the rest with placebo: all of the latter said they were double blind.6 studies used SSRIs, 3 atypical antidepressants, and the remainder tricyclics.Patients treated with antidepressants were significantly more likely to improve than those given placebo (13 studies, OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.27-0.51) or no treatment (1 study, OR 3.45, 95% CI 11.1-1.10). About 4 patients would need to be treated with antidepressants to produce one recovery from depression which would not have occurred had they been given placebo (NNT 4.2, 95% CI 3.2-6.4). Most antidepressants (tricyclics and SSRIs together, 15 trials ) produced a small but significant increase in dropout (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.14-2.40. NNH 9.8, 95% CI 5.4-42.9). The "atypical" antidepressant mianserin produced significantly less dropout than placebo. Only 2 studies used numerical scales designed to measure effects on function and quality of life; in HIV (Karnofsky scale), drug was better than no treatment; in lung disease (Sickness Impact Profile), drug was not significantly different from placebo. Only 7 studies reported looking for changes in the physical disease. Antidepressants produced no change in immune function in HIV relative to placebo (2 studies) or no treatment (1 study). Relative to placebo, antidepressants produced no change in cardiovascular function in heart disease, in respiratory function in lung disease, or in vital signs or laboratory tests in cancer (1 study each). Nortriptyline produced worse control in diabetes. Trends towards tricyclics being more effective than SSRIs, but also more likely to produce dropout were noted, but these are based on non-randomised comparisons between trials. The review provides evidence that antidepressants, significantly more frequently than either placebo or no treatment, cause improvement in depression in patients with a wide range of physical diseases. About 4 patients would need to be treated with antidepressants to produce one recovery from depression which would not have occurred had they been given placebo (NNT 4.2, 95% CI 3.2-6.4). Antidepressants seem reasonably acceptable to patients, in that about 10 patients would need to be treated with antidepressants to produce one dropout from treatment which would not have occurred had they been given placebo (NNH 9.8, 95% CI 5.4-42.9).The evidence is consistent across the trials, apart from 2 trials in cancer, where the "atypical" antidepressant mianserin produced significantly less dropout than placebo. Trends towards tricyclics being more effective than SSRIs, but also more likely to produce dropout were noted, but these are based on non-randomised comparisons between trials. Problems with the evidence include most of the trials' use of observers, rather than patients, to decide on improvement, and concentration mainly on symptoms rather than function and quality of life. There is also a possibility of undetected negative trials.Nevertheless, the review provides evidence that use of antidepressants should at least be considered in those with both physical illness and depression. Regarding diagnosis, the existence of a cheap and readily available treatment for depression should encourage detailed assessment of persistent low mood in the physically ill.}

Relative to placebo, antidepressants produced no change in cardiovascular function in heart disease, in respiratory function in lung disease, or in vital signs or laboratory tests in cancer (1 study each). Nortriptyline produced worse control in diabetes. Trends towards tricyclics being more effective than SSRIs, but also more likely to produce dropout were noted, but these are based on non-randomised comparisons between trials. The review provides evidence that antidepressants, significantly more frequently than either placebo or no treatment, cause improvement in depression in patients with a wide range of physical diseases. About 4 patients would need to be treated with antidepressants to produce one recovery from depression which would not have occurred had they been given placebo (NNT 4.2, 95% CI 3.2-6.4). Antidepressants seem reasonably acceptable to patients, in that about 10 patients would need to be treated with antidepressants to produce one dropout from treatment which would not have occurred had they been given placebo (NNH 9.8, 95% CI 5.4-42.9).

  abstract = {AIDS has become a leading cause of premature mortality in many countries, owing to the decline in other major causes of premature death and the increase in AIDS itself. This study was carried out to determine the trends in premature mortality due to selected causes in Italy. Data from the Italian Mortality Data Base, for the ten years from 1984 to 1993 (the first decade of the AIDS epidemic) were analysed. Premature mortality was measured in terms of years of potential life lost before the age of 70 years (YPLL), excluding infant mortality. Trends in premature mortality due to AIDS were compared with those of the principal causes of premature death: lung cancer, colon-rectum cancer, stomach cancer, leukaemia, female breast cancer, uterine cancer, myocardial infarction, stroke, liver diseases, suicide, road accidents and overdose. In this period there has been a marked increase in premature mortality from AIDS both among males aged 1-69 years (from a rate of YPLL of 0.01 per 1000 in 1984 to 3.71 in 1993) and females of the same age group (from 0 deaths in 1984 to a rate of YPLL of 1.02). Throughout the same period all the other causes of premature death have been declining, with the exception of suicide and overdose among males, and overdose and lung cancer among females. For people aged 25-44 years, AIDS has become the greatest cause of premature death. The increasing trend in premature mortality due to AIDS is most pronounced in the northern and central areas of Italy. AIDS is the leading cause of death among males aged 25-44 years in Italy and is having an important impact on premature mortality among females in the same age group.}

  abstract = {To determine the mortality experience of Hispanic residents of New York City and the influence of birthplace on their mortality rates, NYC Department of Health mortality records for 1988 to 1992 were linked for analysis with 1990 United States census data for New York City. Age-specific death rates for all Hispanics were compared by birthplace with those of non-Hispanic whites. Age-adjusted death rates were also compared. Overall, Hispanics had death rates lower than non-Hispanic blacks, and death rates similar to those of non-Hispanic whites. Hispanics had higher rates of death from HIV-infection, diabetes, stroke/hypertensive disease, cirrhosis and homicide, and fewer deaths from cancer and coronary heart disease than did non-Hispanic whites. Moreover, there were substantial differences in mortality between Hispanic subgroups categorized by birthplace. Migrants from Puerto Rico had the highest, and those from Central and South America the lowest mortality rates. United States-born Hispanics, although younger, had age-adjusted mortality rates higher than New York City non-Hispanic whites. In summary, the mortality of Hispanics generally approximated that of non-Hispanic whites, and was lower than that of non-Hispanic blacks. However, stratification of Hispanics by birthplace revealed substantial variation within the Hispanic population of New York City.}
